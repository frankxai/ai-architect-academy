# AI Architect - Start Here

> **You're an AI Architect.** You design and build production AI systems. This repository gives you patterns, templates, and workflows to do your job better.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

**Practical resources for AI architects:**

1. **[Patterns](../patterns/)** - Production-ready architectures (RAG, agents, multi-modal)
2. **[Templates](../03-templates/)** - Documents you actually use (strategy briefs, technical designs)
3. **[Workflows](../06-agent-workflows/)** - Build faster with Claude Code (recommended) or your tool of choice
4. **[Projects](../05-projects/)** - Full reference implementations

**Everything is open source. Use it, adapt it, contribute back.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 minutes)

### 1. Pick a Pattern

Start with something you need to build:

- **Need a chatbot?** → [RAG Chatbot Pattern](../patterns/chatbots/basic-chatbot/)
- **Building an agent?** → [ReAct Agent Pattern](../patterns/agent-frameworks/react-agent/)
- **Multi-modal AI?** → [Vision + Text Pattern](../patterns/multimodal/vision-text/)

### 2. Choose Your Build Approach

**Option A: With Claude Code (Recommended)**
- Open the pattern's `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- Copy prompts into Claude Code
- Build in 30-60 minutes

**Option B: With Your Preferred Tool**
- Use Cursor, Copilot, or any AI coding assistant
- Adapt the workflow to your tool
- Build at your own pace

**Option C: Manual Development**
- Read the architecture
- Study the code
- Build it yourself

**You choose. We provide the pattern.**

### 3. Deploy and Learn

- Follow the deployment guide
- Test in production
- Understand the architecture
- Adapt for your use case

## 🛠️ Using AI Coding Agents

### We Recommend Claude Code

**Why Claude Code:**
- Long context (200K tokens) - sees your whole system
- Strong at architecture and reasoning
- Good at following patterns
- Works well with our workflows

**But you can use anything:**
- Cursor (fast iterations)
- GitHub Copilot (familiar if you use VS Code)
- Codex (via API)
- ChatGPT (copy-paste)
- Manual coding (full control)

**Our workflows are written for Claude Code, but adapt easily to any tool.**

### How to Use the Workflows

1. Open pattern's `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
2. Read the architecture first
3. Copy prompts into Claude Code (or your tool)
4. Build step by step
5. Test and deploy

**Example: Building RAG Chatbot**
```
Time: 30 minutes with Claude Code
Steps: 5 phases (setup, backend, frontend, polish, deploy)
Result: Working chatbot with vector search
```

```
1. Browse patterns → Find what you need
2. Study architecture → Understand the design
3. Follow workflow → Build with Claude Code
4. Deploy → Production-ready code
```

### 2. Client Presentation

**You need:** Strategy document + technical design
**Use:** [03-templates/strategy/](../03-templates/strategy/)

```
1. AI Strategy Brief → Executive summary
2. Transformation Blueprint → Execution plan
3. Technical Architecture → System design
4. Customize → Add your branding
```

### 3. Research and Validation

**You need:** Evaluate technologies, prove feasibility
**Use:** [03-templates/research/](../03-templates/research/)

```
1. Deep Research Report → Document findings
2. Experiment → Test hypotheses
3. Analyze → Quantify results
4. Recommend → Actionable next steps
```

### 4. Team Enablement

**You need:** Onboard engineers, establish standards
**Use:** [patterns/](../patterns/) + [02-learning-paths/](../02-learning-paths/)

```
1. Share patterns → Team references
