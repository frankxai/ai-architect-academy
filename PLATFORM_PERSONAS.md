6. Assistant Agent → Tests deployment
7. Portfolio Generator → Publishes to showcase
```

```
Professor's Content Flow:
1. Content Generator → Scans GitHub repo
2. ChatGPT → Creates learning modules
3. Curriculum Designer → Builds journey structure
4. Claude Code → Generates agent workflows
5. Assistant Agent → Validates pattern works
6. Marketing Copilot → Creates launch content
```

```
Enterprise's Training Flow:

## 🎯 Platform Value Propositions

### For Students
**Problem:** "I learned React, but can't get hired without portfolio"
**Solution:** Every module = deployed system with live URL

### For Architects
**Problem:** "I build systems but lack credible certification"
**Solution:** Certification = portfolio of production systems

### For Professors
**Problem:** "I have expertise but can't monetize at scale"
**Solution:** Create once, earn 70% revenue forever

### For Assistants (Agents)
**Problem:** "Patterns untested, quality varies, humans slow"
**Solution:** 1000s of agents test/improve 24/7 automatically

### For Enterprises
**Problem:** "Can't find AI talent, training is theoretical"
**Solution:** Hire architects with proven deployed systems

### For Partners
**Problem:** "Need AI talent to drive product adoption"
**Solution:** Co-market to architects building on your stack

  nextStep?: string;
}

// Example: RAG System Build
const ragWorkflow: AgentWorkflow = {
  pattern: ragSystemPattern,
  steps: [
    {
      agent: 'claude-code',
      task: 'Generate base RAG implementation',
      input: { template: 'patterns/rag-system' },
      output: { files: [...] },
      nextStep: 'optimize-embeddings'
    },
    {

      nextStep: 'test'
    },
    {
      agent: 'kilo',
