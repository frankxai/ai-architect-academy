# Creator Studio Launch Guide

Launch a high-velocity creator studio that blends human taste with AI copilots. This guide distils best practices from the new Creator Studio Automation pattern, micro-learning modules, and evaluation workflows so you can move from concept to multi-channel distribution in days, not months.

## 1. Anchor on Outcomes
- **North-star metrics:** retention, audience growth, revenue per campaign, turnaround time.
- **Guardrails:** brand voice, compliance, accessibility, and regional requirements.
- **Success definition:** a single campaign should demonstrate faster production, higher engagement, or better reuse of assets.

## 2. Structure the Production Pipeline
1. **Brief intake:** capture persona, offer, CTA, channel mix, and success metrics. Use forms with schema validation.
2. **Knowledge graph:** store brand voice snippets, value props, FAQs, and evergreen offers in a vector store.
3. **Generation tiers:** split prompts for outlines, long-form scripts, short-form hooks, thumbnails, and distribution copy.
4. **Guardrail service:** enforce tone/style rules, run compliance linting, and attach citations for claims.
5. **Review lanes:** surface diffs, highlight AI-generated sections, and collect reviewer notes in one dashboard.
6. **Publish & measure:** push to CMS, social schedulers, newsletters, and update analytics warehouse for tracking.

## 3. Assign Roles & Rituals
| Persona | Responsibility | AI Assistants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creative Director | Approves campaign brief, calibrates tone, manages backlog | Outline generator, persona reminder bot |
| Editor / Producer | Refines scripts, ensures compliance, orchestrates publishing | Fact-check agent, compliance lint tool |
| Analyst | Monitors performance, designs experiments, communicates insights | Analytics notebook agent, cohort analysis prompts |
| Marketing Ops | Maintains workflow automation, env secrets, CI checks | Promptfoo regression suite, Langfuse dashboards |

## 4. Build the Tech Stack
- **Workflow engine:** Temporal, Camunda, or Make for lighter teams.
- **Content brain:** Postgres + pgvector or Weaviate storing brand assets and prior wins.
- **Model providers:** mix general LLMs (GPT-5 Omni, Claude 3.5) with domain fine-tunes for style consistency.
- **Evaluation & QA:** Promptfoo, Langfuse, custom scripts (see `05-projects/eval-automation`).
- **Distribution:** API-friendly CMS (Contentful, Webflow), social schedulers, email platforms.
- **Analytics:** Mode/Looker dashboards fed by Segment, Snowflake, or BigQuery.

## 5. Implement the Feedback Loop
1. Export analytics weekly and map back to asset IDs.
2. Update prompts with new hooks or CTA insights.
3. Refresh playlists in the Micro-Learning Atlas so the team keeps sharpening skills.
4. Record retros in `reports/creator/retro-<date>.md` and link open actions to project boards.

## 6. Operational Excellence
- **Secrets management:** configure CI secrets for Promptfoo and Langfuse following `dev-setup/ci-secrets.md` (new).
- **Cost visibility:** monitor cost per asset, GPU minutes, and tool subscriptions.
- **Incident response:** document fallback procedures when models drift or APIs fail; keep human editors in the loop.
- **Governance:** ensure data residency and client-specific brand packs remain isolated.

## 7. Launch Checklist
- [ ] Creator Studio Automation pattern reviewed and tailored.
- [ ] Micro-modules scheduled: orchestration, scorecards, analytics loop.
