# AI Lab Research & Curriculum Development Plan

Purpose: Continuously absorb the best pedagogy, frameworks, and research practices from leading AI labs and translate them into the AI Architect Academy patterns, learning paths, and tooling.

## Strategic Goals
- Maintain a living map of AI lab methodologies (research, safety, productisation, tooling).
- Infuse weekly learnings into design patterns, micro-learning modules, and projects.
- Warn early about paradigm shifts (reasoning, agents, safety, infra) and prepare curriculum updates.
- Create reusable assets (briefs, templates, playbooks) for customer engagements.

## Labs & Primary Channels
| Lab / Org | Channels to Monitor | Focus Areas for Academy | Initial Integration Targets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | Research blog, Cookbook, GPT-5 Omni system cards, Safety & alignment updates | Agent orchestration, eval methods, human feedback | Update agentic patterns, Promptfoo scenarios |
| Google DeepMind | Publications, safety blog, Gemini guides, Alpha team tech reports | Reasoning, safety frameworks, RL + simulations | Enrich decision-support & governance modules |
| Anthropic | Claude guides, interpretability blog, policy docs | Constitutional AI, guardrails, interpretability | Strengthen governance/compliance pattern |
| Meta AI | Research blog, open-source repos (Llama, Segment Anything), FAIR papers | Open models, multimodality, infra scaling | Expand AI performance optimisation pattern |
| Microsoft Research / Azure AI | AI system design blog, Responsible AI resources | Enterprise deployment, responsible AI toolchain | Enhance AI CoE governance + SDLC |
| NVIDIA Research | Technical blogs, GTC sessions | Accelerated computing, inference optimisation | Feed into performance optimisation pattern |
| Cohere / AI21 / Mistral | Dev blogs, API updates | Model specialisation, retrieval-friendly tooling | Inform content generation & retrieval modules |
| Allen Institute / Stanford HAI | Policy, ethics, education | Responsible AI education, governance | Integrate into micro-learning & governance tracks |

## Weekly Cadence
| Weekday | Activity | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Scan lab feeds; capture headlines & priority items | `docs/research/weekly-log.md` entries |
| Tuesday | Deep-dive selected papers/guides; extract actionable insights | Insight briefs, references |
| Wednesday | Map insights to Academy patterns/learning paths | Update backlog in this plan |
| Thursday | Prototype integration (pattern updates, micro-modules, evals) | PRs / drafts |
| Friday | Publish weekly summary to persona dashboards / roadmap | Leadership update, retro |

## Workstreams
1. **Intelligence Gathering**  
   - Maintain `docs/research/weekly-log.md` (template below).  
   - Use RSS/alerts, track release calendars (OpenAI DevDay, Google I/O, GTC).  

2. **Curriculum Integration**  
   - Align new insights to existing modules (micro-learning, projects).  
   - Create update tickets referencing patterns (e.g., `content-generation`, `decision-support`).  
   - Schedule quarterly curriculum reviews.

3. **Asset Development**  
   - Produce briefs, diagrams, evaluation templates aligning with lab approaches.  
   - Add usage examples or code snippets to patterns/projects.  

4. **Governance & Safety**  
   - Track safety frameworks (Constitutional AI, RAIL licenses).  
   - Update governance checklists accordingly.  

5. **Enablement & Storytelling**  
   - Share insights via articles (`09-articles/`), persona dashboards, or executive summaries.  
   - Host periodic workshops or office hours.

## Research Questions
- How do labs measure agent reliability and safety?  
- What evaluation frameworks are emerging for reasoning, tool use, multimodal tasks?  
- Which curriculum resources (courses, demos) resonate with enterprise teams?  
- What infrastructure blueprints (hardware, orchestration) should patterns emphasise?

## Delivery Rhythm
- **Monthly**: Synthesize learnings into roadmap updates (`00-roadmap/ROADMAP.md`).
- **Quarterly**: Major curriculum refresh, release new micro-modules or projects.  
- **Annually**: Publish State of AI Architecture report summarizing cross-lab insights.

## Next Actions
1. Create `docs/research/weekly-log.md` and log current week.  
2. Review latest releases (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic) and populate backlog.  
3. Open tickets/PRs for high-priority integrations (guardrails, reasoning, performance).  
4. Update design patterns / learning paths accordingly.  
5. Share summary with leadership and community.
