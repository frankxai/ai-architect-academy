Ship fast, update often. - **Accessible to all.** Friends, family, enterprise buyers, and influencers should find a path immediately."

    "content": "# Working With AI Assistants (Playbook) Goal: Get high‑quality, verifiable outcomes quickly while keeping control over scope, cost, and quality. Principles - Be specific: State goal, constraints, acceptance criteria, and non‑goals. - Provide context: File paths, snippets, errors, env, versions. - Ask for a plan: Have the AI outline steps; approve/refine. - Prefer minimal diffs: Request patch/diff instead of full files. - Verify: Run tests, check outputs, and ask for self‑checks. - Iterate: Small scopes → apply → re‑ask with updated context. When to use which tool - Editor‑native (Claude Code, Continue, Cursor): fast inline edits and refactors. - Git‑aware CLI (Aider, Codex CLI): patch‑first changes with review and commits. - Long‑running agents (Devin): exploratory tasks; keep guardrails and review gates. Common patterns - Spec → Tests → Code: Ask for acceptance tests before implementation. - Investigate → Hypothesize → Patch: Paste stack traces; ask for debugging steps. - Design Doc → Skeleton → Fill‑in: Draft and iterate on design before coding. Anti‑patterns - Vague asks; no acceptance criteria. - Oversized changes in one shot. - Blindly pasting generated code without review."

    "content": "# Start Here — Build Your AI Architect Command Center You’re here because you want to ship real AI value, guide stakeholders with confidence, and make your work easy to share. This quick guide orients you to the full experience so you can get momentum within minutes. ## 1. Choose Your Mission Profile ### Launchpad — First 100 Hours - Follow the [100-Hour AI Architect plan](02-learning-paths/100-hour-ai-architect.md) to sprint through foundations, shipping, and storytelling. - Pair the plan with three anchor projects: [RAG on Supabase](05-projects/rag-on-supabase.md), [Langfuse evals](05-projects/evals-langfuse.md), and [Vector search benchmarks](05-projects/vector-search-pgvector.md). ### Creator & Influencer Track - Use the [Beginner](02-learning-paths/beginner.md) and [Professional](02-learning-paths/professional.md) paths to pace long-form content, workshops, and community sessions. - Pull examples and citations from the [Awesome collections](03-awesome/) and [Articles](09-articles/) folders. ### Enterprise & AI CoE Leadership - Run the [Bootcamp](02-learning-paths/bootcamp.md) to align product, platform, risk, and ops teams. - Combine architecture patterns ( ) with the [Governance toolkit](08-governance/) and [Collaboration playbooks](16-collaboration/) for executive visibility. ### Advisors, Clients, Friends & Family - Share the [Experience page](docs/experience.html) when introducing the hub to new collaborators. - Use to spin up proposals, meeting notes, and recap reports fast. ## 2. Map Your Architecture Playbook - Start with three core patterns: [Content Generation](01-design-patterns/content-generation.md), [Decision Support](01-design-patterns/decision-support.md), and [Model Lifecycle Management](01-design-patterns/model-lifecycle-management.md). - Explore the [Concept decks](12-concepts/) for mental models (retrieval, evaluation, observability, safety) you can present to stakeholders. - Browse [Platforms](docs/platforms.html) and [Cloud blueprints](docs"
