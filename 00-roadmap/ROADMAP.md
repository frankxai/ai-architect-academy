# Experience Roadmap

Stay transparent about what exists, what is in motion, and what experiments are lined up. Share this with clients, collaborators, or your own AI agents so everyone has the same map.

## Shipping Now
- **Experience blueprint refresh.** Harmonised README, Start Here, Experience hub, and navigation copy with persona-first storytelling.
- **Agent-ready assets.** Updated SVG infographics, reinforced metadata, and guidance so Codex-style copilots can brief visitors.
- **Search + SEO alignment.** Regenerated search index, tuned sitemap, and fortified keyword anchors across core landing pages.

## Next 30 Days
- **Persona dashboards.** Interactive cards on the Experience page that surface real-time highlights from learning paths, projects, and governance modules.
- **Interactive project filters.** Extend `docs/projects.html` with saved views (RAG, Agentic, Ops) and search presets tuned for exec, architect, and creator intents.
- **Governance deep dives.** Expand `08-governance/` with procurement guidance, incident response drilldowns, and human-in-the-loop review checklists.
- **Agent toolkit.** Package prompt starters, system messages, and evaluation rubrics so teams can deploy internal agents safely.

## 60–90 Day Horizon
- **Playground templates.** Bundle minimal repos for each flagship project with dockerised quick starts, CI-ready eval harnesses, and cost dashboards.
- **Persona onboarding sequences.** Optional email or chat drip scripts referencing repo content, roadmap milestones, and collaboration rituals.
- **Experience analytics.** Surface repo commit velocity, project freshness, and evaluation coverage on homepage pulse cards and README callouts.
- **Certification loop.** Design a capstone assessment that blends pattern mastery, governance readiness, and storytelling artefacts.

## Guiding Principles
- **Lead with clarity.** Every page answers “what value do I get in five minutes?”
- **Ship in loops.** Pattern → Project → Evaluation → Story is the default development cadence.
- **Stay truthful.** Document only what exists or is in flight. Ship fast, update often.
- **Accessible to all.** Friends, family, enterprise buyers, and influencers should immediately find a lane.
- **Agent-inclusive.** Assume AI copilots and automation scripts are exploring alongside humans—give them breadcrumbs in every update.
