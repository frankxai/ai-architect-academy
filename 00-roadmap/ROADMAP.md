# Experience Roadmap

## Shipping Now
- **Unified navigation + experience hub.** Refreshed `docs/` with an Experience page, consistent nav, and persona-first copy.
- **Brand voice alignment.** Added `BRAND-VOICE.md` and updated `README` + `START-HERE` to reflect the new narrative.
- **Visual system.** New SVG assets (`assets/experience-map.svg`, `assets/value-loop.svg`) mirrored under `docs/assets/` for the live site.

## Next 30 Days
- **AI Lab Research Sync.** Launch weekly intelligence loop covering OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA; feed updates into design patterns and micro-learning modules.
- **Persona dashboards.** Build dynamic cards on the Experience page that auto-pull highlights from learning paths, projects, and governance modules.
- **Interactive project filters.** Extend `docs/projects.html` with saved views (RAG, Agentic, Ops) and top-tier search presets.
- **Governance deep dives.** Expand `08-governance/` with checklists for procurement, incident response, and human-in-the-loop reviews.

## 60–90 Day Horizon
- **Playground templates.** Bundle minimal repos for each flagship project with dockerised quick starts and CI-ready eval harnesses.
- **Persona-specific onboarding emails.** Ship optional email sequences that reference repo content and live site milestones.
- **Metrics dashboard.** Surface repo commit velocity, project freshness, and evaluation coverage on the homepage pulse cards.

## Guiding Principles
- **Lead with clarity.** Every page answers “what value do I get in five minutes?”
- **Ship in loops.** Pattern → Project → Eval → Story is the default development cadence.
- **Stay truthful.** Document only what exists or is in flight. Ship fast, update often.
- **Accessible to all.** Friends, family, enterprise buyers, and influencers should find a path immediately.
