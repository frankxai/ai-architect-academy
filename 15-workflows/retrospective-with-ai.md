# Retrospective with AI Assistant

15-minute loop to capture learnings with your AI copilot after every sprint or study week.

## Prep
- Share the latest metrics, eval results, and guardrail incidents.
- Keep the screenshot from Langfuse or your dashboard ready.

## Script
1. **Win scan (3 min):** Prompt the assistant to list outcomes, surprises, and high-signal artefacts. Validate and add context.
2. **Metric review (4 min):** Inspect latency, cost, eval scores. Ask "What changed?" and "What pattern do we see?"
3. **Risk radar (3 min):** Have the assistant enumerate new risks, policy changes, or data quality issues.
4. **Next experiments (3 min):** Co-draft the next two experiments, including success criteria.
5. **Commitments (2 min):** Log owners, dates, and supporting assets.
