# Peer Review Ritual

Use this 20-minute loop with another architect or engineer to stress-test work before shipping.

## Preparation
- Share artifact in advance (notebook, PR, deck).
- Provide context: goal, audience, current risks.

## Live Agenda
1. **Orientation (2 min):** Presenter frames scope + desired feedback.
2. **Walkthrough (6 min):** Presenter demos while reviewer captures questions.
3. **Deep dive (8 min):** Reviewer probes on assumptions, eval coverage, governance, comms.
4. **Decide (2 min):** Agree on ship/no-ship, outstanding tasks, owners.
5. **Log (2 min):** Update `02-learning-paths/logbook.md` or issue tracker.

## Prompt Pack
- "List the top three failure modes for this design."
- "Suggest guardrails or evals missing from this plan."
- "Draft a one-line executive summary of this artifact."

## Follow-up
- Capture decisions in PR comments or shared doc.
- Book a follow-up if high-risk items remain.
