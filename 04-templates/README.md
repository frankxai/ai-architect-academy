## Usage Tips

**All templates are customizable:**
- Remove sections that don't apply
- Add company-specific sections
- Adjust depth based on project size

**Version control:**
- Keep templates in version control
- Track changes over project lifecycle
- Share learnings across teams

**Quality over completion:**
- Better to complete key sections well
- Than to rush through entire template
- Focus on decisions and rationale

## Template Standards

All templates follow these principles:

1. **Opinionated but flexible** - Clear guidance, adaptable to context
2. **Action-oriented** - Drive decisions and implementation
3. **Evidence-based** - Ground recommendations in data
4. **Stakeholder-focused** - Address real business needs
