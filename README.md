## The Experience at a Glance
- **Explore the live atlas.** Browse the [GitHub Pages site](https://ai-architect-academy.github.io/ai-architect-academy/) with unified navigation, topic landing pages, and fast search.
- **Clone the full operating system.** Pull the repo to unlock scripts, prompt packs, workflows, and design assets for your team and AI assistants.
- **Tell a sharper story.** Use the [Brand Voice playbook](BRAND-VOICE.md) to stay on-message with executives, clients, and your audience.
- **Ship and scale.** Pair enterprise-ready patterns with hands-on projects, eval workflows, and governance checklists.
- **Level up the curriculum.** Follow the [Curriculum Architecture](02-learning-paths/curriculum-architecture.md) to move from the 100-hour sprint to executive bootcamps and agentic labs.

## Why Clone the Repository
- **Offline & private workspaces.** Serve the site locally (`scripts/serve.sh`) and pair with your favourite AI copilots using the curated prompt packs in `prompt-packs/`.
- **Pattern-first development.** Everything is structured for reuse: design blueprints (`01-design-patterns/`), project guides (`05-projects/`), workflows (`15-workflows/`), and collaboration rituals (`16-collaboration/`).
- **Integrated storytelling.** Use `09-articles/` for long-form thought leadership, `03-awesome/` for curated references, and `10-resources/` when you need trusted links fast.
- **Extend with ease.** Regenerate search data (`npm run build:index`), capture screenshots (`npm run screenshots`), and drop new visuals into `assets/` for instant publishing.

## Signature Loops You Can Run This Week
![Value Loop](assets/value-loop.svg)
- **Pattern → Project → Eval:** Pick a pattern, ship the smallest valuable build, and wire in evaluation harnesses on day one.
- **Concept → Platform Decision:** Use the concept decks and platform matrix to align your stack before writing code.
- **Learning Path → Portfolio:** Follow the 100-hour track, ship two case studies, and use the article templates to publish your wins.
- **Governance → Collaboration:** Stand up policy baselines, then drop the collaboration checklists into your team rituals.

## Start Your Journey (Choose the Lane that Fits)
- **Launchpad (100 hours).** Sprint through foundations, retrieval, observability, and storytelling with the refreshed [100-Hour Plan](02-learning-paths/100-hour-ai-architect.md).
- **Creators & Educators.** Run workshops, newsletters, and community drops using the [Creator Launch Sequence](02-learning-paths/beginner.md) plus the [Brand Voice playbook](BRAND-VOICE.md).
- **Professional Architects.** Join the six-week [Professional Studio](02-learning-paths/professional.md) to orchestrate multi-model systems with evaluation-first rigor.
- **Enterprise & AI CoE Leaders.** Facilitate alignment with the revamped [Bootcamp](02-learning-paths/bootcamp.md), governance toolkits, and collaboration rituals.
- **Agentic Innovators.** Layer in [Agentic Code Swarms](02-learning-paths/agentic-code-swarms.md), experiment with orchestrators, and publish learnings via the [Agentic SaaS Planner](05-projects/agentic-saas-planner.md).

## Operate with Confidence
- **Evaluation stack:** [Metrics](07-evaluation/metrics.md), [Eval harness](07-evaluation/eval-harness.md), and [promptfoo integrations](05-projects/evals-langfuse.md).
- **Guardrails & governance:** [Privacy & GDPR](08-governance/privacy-gdpr.md), [Model risk](08-governance/model-risk.md), and policy templates.
- **Tooling matrix:** [Stack reference](06-toolchains/stack-reference.md), [Cloud blueprints](docs/clouds.html), and [Platform comparisons](docs/platforms.html).
- **Curriculum cadence:** Revisit the [Curriculum Architecture](02-learning-paths/curriculum-architecture.md) quarterly to plug in updated benchmarks, model releases, and sector case studies.

## Create Momentum for Your Brand & Community
- Publish your progress using the [article outlines](09-articles/) and [content prompts](prompt-packs/).
- Share live demos via the [Projects catalog](docs/projects.html) and embed screenshots captured with `node scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`.
- Use the [Collaborate](docs/collaborate.html) guide to co-create with AI teammates, clients, friends, or family exploring the space.

## Contribute & Extend
- Open an issue or PR with a clear “why it matters” note. Templates live under `04-templates/`.
- Keep the tone on-brand by checking [BRAND-VOICE.md](BRAND-VOICE.md).
- Update the search index after major content changes: `npm install` (first time) then `npm run build:index`.
- Capture new visuals: drop SVG/PNGs into `assets/` and `docs/assets/` to surface them across the repo and site.
