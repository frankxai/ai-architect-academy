# AI Architect Academy — Open Playbook for Builders

Become the architect who can design, ship, and operate AI systems that matter. This repo is a high‑signal, living guide: patterns, projects, and the best open resources — curated and connected so you can move fast with confidence.

## Your Learning Journey
- Orient: Read Start‑Here and pick a path (100‑Hour, Beginner, Pro, Bootcamp)
- Ground: Learn Enterprise Patterns (value, architecture, discovery, BoM)
- Build: Ship hands‑on projects (RAG, Agents, Evals, Observability)
- Operate: Add SLOs, guardrails, governance, and cost controls
- Specialize: Choose an industry pattern and publish a portfolio PoC
