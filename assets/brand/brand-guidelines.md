# AI Architect Academy — Brand & Story Guidelines

## Narrative
- Mission: Empower builders to design, ship, and operate agentic AI systems responsibly.
- Promise: High‑signal, hands‑on, production‑minded guidance you can use today.
- Voice: Clear, direct, practical. Confident but humble. Builder‑first.

## Personas
- AI Architect (lead): orchestrates agents, patterns, and platform choices
- Engineer (maker): implements tools, tests, and integrations
- Product/PM (partner): outcomes, scope, risks, adoption

## Visual Identity
- Logo: `assets/logo.svg` (simple geometric mark)
- Colors: Indigo (primary), Cyan (accents), Slate (neutral)
- Layout: generous spacing, dense information grouped into visual blocks

## Writing Style
- Lead with outcomes → steps → references
- Use parallel structure, bullet lists, and short code blocks
- Prefer BoMs, diagrams, and checklists over prose where possible

## Agentic Code Swarms Theme
- Metaphor: small focused agents collaborating like a pit crew
- Show roles, handoffs, and critique loops visually
- Emphasize safety: evals, guardrails, and budget limits

## Assets To Produce (suggested)
- Diagram set: roles, messages, orchestrators (`assets/diagrams/`)
- UI screenshots: Streamlit Explorer states (`assets/screenshots/`)
- Templates: prompts, BoM, architecture (`04-templates/`)

## Usage Guidelines
- Prefer SVG for diagrams and logos
- Keep code blocks minimal; link to runnable examples
- Cite sources and licenses for any third‑party assets
