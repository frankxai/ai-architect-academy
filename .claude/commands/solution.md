# Solution

The student is requesting the solution for the current lab.

Read `.academy/progress.json` to check:
1. Have they attempted the lab? (at least 1 hint used or 1 review done)
2. What's their current score?

**If they haven't attempted yet:**
"I can show you the solution, but you'll learn more by trying first. Type /start-lab [id] to begin, or /hint for a clue."

**If they've attempted but scored < 50:**
Show the solution step-by-step with detailed explanations of WHY each fix works. This is teaching mode, not just an answer key.

**If they scored >= 50:**
Show the solution and highlight the differences from their approach. "Your solution works, but here's the production-grade version..."

**Always:**
- Explain the architectural reasoning, not just the code
- Show before/after comparisons
- Link to relevant skills for deeper learning
- Update progress.json to mark solution as viewed
