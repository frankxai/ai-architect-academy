# Discovery Questions: Multi-Modal AI Analytics

<discovery_current_state>
## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of data do you currently analyze separately (text documents, audio recordings, video content, sensor data), and how do you currently correlate insights across these different data types?**
   - *Purpose: Identify multi-modal data sources and understand current analysis limitations*

2. **What business scenarios require understanding of multiple data types simultaneously (customer behavior analysis, security monitoring, patient assessment, urban planning), and how do you currently approach these complex analyses?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 65% accuracy improvement through holistic understanding*

3. **What are the current limitations of your single-mode analysis approaches, and where do you suspect you might be missing important patterns or insights?**
   - *Purpose: Identify gaps that multi-modal analysis could address*
