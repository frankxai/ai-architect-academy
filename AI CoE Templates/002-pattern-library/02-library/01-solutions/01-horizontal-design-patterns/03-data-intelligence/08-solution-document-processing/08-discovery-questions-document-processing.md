# Discovery Questions: Intelligent Document Processing

<discovery_current_state>
## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **What types of documents does your organization process most frequently (insurance claims, loan applications, medical records, contracts, tax documents), and what is your current processing workflow?**
   - *Purpose: Identify high-volume document types and understand existing processes*

2. **How much time and resources do you currently spend on document processing and data entry, and what are your current accuracy rates and error types?**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for 80% time reduction and 95% accuracy improvement claims*

3. **What document formats do you work with (PDFs, scanned images, handwritten forms, structured forms), and how do you currently extract and validate data from these documents?**
   - *Purpose: Assess document complexity and current extraction capabilities*
