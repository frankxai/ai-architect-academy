# Pattern 34: AI Compliance Navigator

<solution_overview>
## Solution Overview

The AI Compliance Navigator pattern establishes an intelligent, automated platform that continuously monitors, interprets, and enforces regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions and frameworks. This pattern leverages natural language processing to understand complex regulations, machine learning to map requirements to controls, and automation to maintain continuous compliance while dramatically reducing manual effort and compliance costs.
