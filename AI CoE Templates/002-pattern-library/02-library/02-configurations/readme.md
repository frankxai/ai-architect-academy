# Solution Configuration Repository

## Purpose

This folder contains implementation-specific configurations for solution design patterns within the AI Center of Excellence (AICOE) pattern library.

## Configuration Types

Configurations may include:

- **Parameter Sets**: Tuned values for solution deployment
- **Algorithm Selection**: Chosen algorithms for specific implementations
- **Fine-tuning Specifications**: Process parameters for model optimization
- **Implementation Variants**: Solution adaptations for specific use cases

## Scope

Each configuration relates to the practical implementation of solutions for:
- Specific use cases
- Industry verticals
- Customer requirements
