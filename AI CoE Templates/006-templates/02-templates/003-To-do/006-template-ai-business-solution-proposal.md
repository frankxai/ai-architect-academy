# Strategic AI Solution Proposal Template

This template provides a comprehensive framework for proposing AI-powered business solutions with strategic focus on business value and transformation outcomes.

## Template Usage Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Sections marked with `readonly="true"` contain non-editable template defaults for strategic proposal standards and business-focused guidelines. These establish consistent strategic principles across all AI solution proposals.

**Key Template Features:**
- **Strategic Business Focus**: Emphasizes business value and transformation over technical implementation
- **Qualitative Benefits**: Uses strategic language avoiding specific metrics and timelines
- **XML Structure**: Consistent structured format for proposal components

**Editable sections**: Replace placeholder text `[like this]` with project-specific content.
**Non-editable sections**: Marked with ⚠️ warnings - use as-is for strategic consistency and business focus.
