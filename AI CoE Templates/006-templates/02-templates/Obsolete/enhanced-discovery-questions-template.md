<discovery_current_state>
## Discovery & Current State Assessment

1. **[Current state question about primary challenge or process, e.g., What types of AI-related challenges (e.g., predictive analytics, GenAI automation) are you facing?]**
   - *Purpose: Identify key use cases, **AI application type/fit**, and understand existing landscape. (Maps to Core Criterion: AI Application Type and Fit – Score High if aligns with Oracle strengths like RAG/OCI Vision.)*

2. **[Question about current systems, processes, or data handling]**
   - *Purpose: Assess maturity, **problem complexity**, and integration complexity. (Maps to Core Criterion: Industry Relevance and Problem Complexity.)*

3. **[Question about current timeline, bottlenecks, or pain points]**
   - *Purpose: Establish baseline for improvement metrics **and scalability potential**.*

<strategy_business_alignment>
## Strategy & Business Alignment

4. **[Question about organizational strategic priorities and alignment, e.g., How does this initiative align with emerging trends like sustainability or personalization?]**
   - *Purpose: Align solution value proposition with business strategy **and strategic alignment criterion**. (Maps to Enhancement Criterion: Strategic Alignment.)*

5. **[Question about business functions or areas that would benefit most, e.g., In which sectors (finance, healthcare) and with what complexity (e.g., regulated data processing)?]**
   - *Purpose: Prioritize implementation approach, identify quick wins, **and assess industry relevance**.*

6. **[Question about current measurement and success criteria]**
   - *Purpose: Establish success criteria and ROI measurement framework **, including expected impact metrics (e.g., cost reduction, efficiency gains)**. (Maps to Enhancement Criterion: Scalability and Impact.)*

<innovation_potential_assessment>
## Innovation & Potential Assessment (New Section)

10. **Does this opportunity involve novel AI integrations (e.g., multi-modal analytics, agentic workflows) that differentiate from standard solutions? Provide examples.**
    - *Purpose: Evaluate **innovation and differentiation potential**. (Maps to Core Criterion: Innovation and Differentiation Potential – Score High for novel applications like LLM-based automation.)*

11. **What data sources (e.g., knowledge bases, APIs) are available, and how ready are they for AI integration (e.g., structured vs. unstructured)?**
    - *Purpose: Assess **data and integration readiness**. (Maps to Enhancement Criterion: Data and Integration Readiness.)*

<technical_scoping_architecture>
## Technical Scoping & Architecture

12. **[Question about current infrastructure and platform preferences]**
    - *Purpose: Assess technical fit and migration requirements.*

13. **[Question about data characteristics and performance expectations, e.g., Can the solution scale to high volumes (e.g., 50k documents/year)?]**
    - *Purpose: Size resources and determine technical requirements **for scalability**.*

<security_compliance>
## Security & Compliance

14. **[Question about security, privacy, and regulatory requirements, e.g., Are there ethical AI needs like privacy in regulated industries?]**
    - *Purpose: Design appropriate security architecture and controls **, aligning with compliant AI criteria**.*

15. **[Question about specific compliance or audit requirements]**
    - *Purpose: Configure security features and compliance monitoring.*
</security_compliance>
