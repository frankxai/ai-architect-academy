# Template Usage Prompts

This directory contains structured prompts for generating customer-ready artifacts and solution pattern content using the design pattern templates.

## Available Prompts

| Prompt File | Template Used | Output | Use Case |
|-------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `customer-target-architecture-prompt.md` | target-architecture-template.md | Customer-specific architecture document | Customer proposals, SOW input |
| `solution-pattern-documentation-prompt.md` | design-pattern-template.md | Complete pattern documentation | Pattern library, solution guides |
| `customer-discovery-session-prompt.md` | discovery-questions-template.md | Tailored discovery questions | Customer engagements, requirements gathering |
| `bill-of-materials-generation-prompt.md` | bill-of-materials-template.md | Detailed resource requirements | Cost estimation, project planning |

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Select the appropriate prompt** based on your deliverable needs
2. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with specific customer and project information
3. **Provide the completed prompt** to your AI assistant or documentation system
4. **Review and customize** the generated output for your specific requirements
5. **Validate technical accuracy** and business alignment before distribution

## Example Workflow

### For Customer Deliverables:
1. Use `customer-discovery-session-prompt.md` to prepare for customer meetings
2. Use `customer-target-architecture-prompt.md` to create proposal documents
3. Use `bill-of-materials-generation-prompt.md` for cost estimation and resource planning

### For Internal Documentation:
1. Use `solution-pattern-documentation-prompt.md` to document new patterns
2. Reference generated patterns for future customer engagements
3. Build pattern library for solution architects and sales engineers

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide detailed context rather than generic information
- **Include Constraints**: Mention known limitations, preferences, or requirements
- **Define Success**: Clearly articulate what the output should achieve
- **Consider Audience**: Tailor complexity and focus for the intended readers
- **Iterate and Refine**: Use initial outputs to refine prompts for better results
- **Validate Outputs**: Review generated content for accuracy and completeness

## Customization Guidelines

These prompts can be customized for:
- **Industry-specific requirements** (healthcare, financial services, manufacturing)
- **Technology focus areas** (AI/ML, data analytics, security, integration)
- **Customer segments** (enterprise, mid-market, SMB)
- **Engagement types** (POC, full implementation, migration)
