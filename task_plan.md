# Task Plan: AI Architect Academy V4 - Ground-Up Evolution

## Goal
Transform the AI Architect Academy into the #1 GitHub repository for learning to build AI architects through coding agents, with world-class UX, visual appeal, and synthesized intelligence from top repositories.

## Current Phase
Phase 3 (Core System Build) - In Progress

## Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Strategy ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Understand current academy structure
- [x] Research top GitHub AI repositories
- [x] Analyze Claude Code skills patterns
- [x] Review global skills (agentic-orchestration, cacos, claude-sdk)
- [x] Document synthesis strategy
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Architecture Design ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design "Coding Agents First" philosophy
- [x] Create skill hierarchy (Foundation → Expert)
- [x] Define visual identity & UX standards
- [x] Plan GitHub repo structure for maximum appeal
- [x] Design progressive learning system
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Core System Build ✅ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Build CLAUDE.md master configuration
- [x] Create skill activation system (keyword-based)
- [ ] Implement agentic workflows
- [ ] Build evaluation/certification framework
- [x] Create visual README with badges/diagrams
- [x] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with templates
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 4: Skills Library
- [ ] Consolidate 80+ skills into coherent system
- [ ] Create AI Architect skill progressions
- [ ] Build multi-cloud architect skills
- [ ] Implement hands-on coding challenges
- [ ] Create agent swarm templates
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: UX & Visual Excellence
- [ ] Design stunning README.md
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams (D2/Mermaid)
- [ ] Build interactive learning paths
- [ ] Add GitHub-native features (Discussions, Projects)
- [ ] Create demo GIFs and screenshots
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test all skills work correctly
- [ ] Verify learning paths flow
- [ ] Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Community feedback integration
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
1. What makes top GitHub repos so appealing? → Clean README, badges, clear value prop, demos
2. How to make "coding agents first"? → Every lesson has runnable agent code
3. What skills differentiate top AI architects? → Multi-cloud, orchestration, evaluation, security
4. How to transform Claude Code into an academy? → Skills + Learning Paths + Projects + Certification

## Synthesis from Top Repositories

### From CrewAI (~20K stars)
- Role-based agent collaboration
- Clear agent definition patterns
- Simple yet powerful API

### From MetaGPT
- Software company simulation model
- Multi-role coordination
- Requirements-to-code pipeline

### From awesome-ai-agents
- Curated, organized categorization
- Regular updates
- Community contributions

### From LangFlow (~140K stars)
- No-code/low-code approach
- Visual pipeline builder
- Democratized AI development

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Coding Agents First" philosophy | Every lesson includes runnable agent code |
| Progressive skill system | Foundation → Advanced → Expert certification |
| Multi-cloud focus | Real architects work across AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI |
| Claude Code native | Transform the CLI into the learning environment itself |
| Visual excellence priority | GitHub repos succeed on first impression |
| Synthesis over invention | Pull best patterns from top repositories |

## Notes
- Focus on making Claude Code THE learning environment, not just documentation
- Every skill should be immediately actionable with /skill commands
- Visual appeal is crucial for GitHub success
- Synthesize, don't reinvent - build on proven patterns
