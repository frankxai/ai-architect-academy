# Claude Code (Anthropic)

- What: IDE and web assistant for code with strong reasoning and refactoring.
- Setup: https://www.anthropic.com/claude
- Use: Pair for big-picture refactors, doc generation, and design. Provide repo context (files, errors) and ask for patch diffs.
- Tips: Prefer "show me a minimal diff"; iterate with test stubs; paste stack traces and failing tests.
