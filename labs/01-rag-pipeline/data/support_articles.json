If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you will also need your authenticator app. The new password must be at least 12 characters with one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. Password changes take effect immediately across all active sessions. If you are locked out of your account, contact support@example.com with your account ID for manual verification. The verification process typically takes 1-2 business days. Note: Password reset links expire after 15 minutes for security. If your link has expired, request a new one from the login page.",

Current average response times: Starter (avg 200ms, p99 800ms), Professional (avg 100ms, p99 400ms), Enterprise (avg 50ms, p99 200ms, dedicated instances).",
