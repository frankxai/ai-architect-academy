# Pattern: AI Performance Optimization

## Business Value
- Maximise responsiveness and throughput of AI services, improving user experiences and unlocking higher transaction volumes at lower unit cost.
- Enable teams to experiment rapidly by providing predictable performance envelopes and capacity planning insights.
- Reduce infrastructure spend by right-sizing models, leveraging hardware acceleration, and caching intelligently.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Profiling & Benchmarking**: Automated load tests measure latency, throughput, and token compute across representative workloads.
2. **Model Optimisation**: Techniques such as quantisation, distillation, sparse attention, or retrieval caching reduce inference costs while maintaining quality.
3. **Serving Infrastructure**: Scalable serving stack (Kubernetes + KServe/Triton) with autoscaling, request batching, and multi-model hosting.
4. **Edge & Caching Strategies**: Response caching, embedding reuse, and on-device inference for low-latency scenarios where feasible.
5. **Observability & Feedback**: Real-time telemetry for latency, cost per request, and quality metrics drives dynamic load shedding and routing decisions.

## Discovery Questions
- What latency and throughput targets are required for each user journey, and how do they vary by customer segment or geography?
- Which hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU) are available, and what is the cost profile or utilisation targets for each?
- How frequently do models or prompts change, and how will performance regressions be detected during rollout?
- Where are caching or edge deployments acceptable considering data residency, privacy, and update cadences?

## Bill of Materials
- Benchmarking tools (Locust, k6), profiling suites (PyTorch Profiler, Nvidia Nsight) and synthetic workload generators.
- Optimisation libraries: ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, DeepSpeed, vLLM for context caching and parallelism.
- Serving platform: Kubernetes with auto-scaling (HPA/KEDA), load balancer (Envoy/NGINX), and feature store for low-latency retrieval.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces, metrics pipeline (Prometheus/Grafana), cost dashboards (FinOps tooling), alerting (PagerDuty).

## Risks & Controls
- **Quality Degradation**: Validate optimisation techniques against golden datasets; maintain dual-run comparisons before cutover.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Implement backpressure, rate limiting, and graceful degradation strategies to protect shared infrastructure.
- **Cost Overruns**: Track cost per 1K tokens/request, enforce budgets, and tune autoscaling policies; archive unused models.
- **Security Exposure**: Harden serving endpoints, ensure TLS termination, and separate tenant workloads to avoid side-channel leakage.
