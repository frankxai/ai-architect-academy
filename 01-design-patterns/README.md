Each pattern file documents:
1. Business value narratives that clarify why the pattern matters.
2. A reference architecture with reasoning behind major components.
3. Discovery questions to align stakeholders and surface constraints early.
4. A bill of materials to accelerate vendor/tool selection and delivery planning.
5. Key risks with pragmatic controls informed by real-world deployments.

Use the patterns as starting points—extend them with your organisation's context, decision gates, and compliance requirements before implementation.
