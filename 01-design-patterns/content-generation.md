# Pattern: Content Generation

## Business Value
- Compress campaign and asset production cycles from weeks to hours, enabling faster GTM iterations and multivariate experimentation.
- Produce hyper-personalized content that reflects customer intent, compliance posture, and brand voice while scaling to long-tail segments.
- Free subject-matter experts from repetitive drafting so they can focus on high-signal review, governance, and performance improvement.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Brief & Context Intake**: Marketing brief, product catalogue, historical performance metrics, and tone guidance enter an orchestrated workflow (Temporal/Prefect) that normalizes metadata.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: A hybrid search (vector + keyword) layer over product knowledge, FAQs, and policy memos retrieves grounding snippets with provenance tags.
3. **Generation & Adaptation**: Prompt templates select the appropriate foundation or fine-tuned model (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) with controllable decoding for long-form vs. short-form assets.
4. **Guardrails & Review**: Automatic redaction, toxicity checks, policy linting, and side-by-side diff tooling feed a reviewer dashboard with accept/reject/annotate actions before CMS publish.
5. **Observability & Feedback**: Langfuse/Weights & Biases capture latency, cost, and evaluation metrics (groundedness, tone, conversion lift) for continuous tuning.

## Discovery Questions
- Which gold-standard assets best represent brand voice, and how frequently do guidelines change?
- What regulatory frameworks (GDPR, FINRA, HIPAA) constrain language, disclosures, or data flows?
- How will performance be measured (CTR, pipeline contribution, NPS) and fed back into prompts or selection strategies?
- What human review SLA is acceptable, and who owns final approval for different campaign tiers?

## Bill of Materials
- Orchestrator (Temporal/Prefect), feature store for campaign metadata, secure prompt store, and CMS connectors (Contentful, Adobe Experience Manager).
- Hybrid retrieval layer (pgvector or Pinecone + Postgres), policy engine (Open Policy Agent), evaluation harness (DeepEval, custom Jupyter), and analytics warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery).
- Optional personalization services (Segment, Braze) to push generated variants to targeted cohorts.

## Risks & Controls
- **Hallucinations**: Enforce retrieval-augmented prompting with citation requirements, abstain on low-confidence generations, and maintain regression tests on critical intents.
- **Brand Drift**: Codify tone and legal constraints as structured rules; run automated style scoring; require reviewer attestation for top-tier campaigns.
- **Data Leakage**: Tokenize or redact PII before model calls, isolate prompt logs, and implement role-based access to reviewer feedback and datasets.
- **Operational Overhead**: Automate evaluation runbooks and cost dashboards so marketing ops can manage scaling without engineering bottlenecks.
