# Pattern: Decision Support

## Business Value
- Shorten the time from data availability to defensible action by surfacing curated evidence, policy constraints, and confidence signals in one workspace.
- Improve consistency of high-impact decisions (credit, underwriting, staffing) by encoding playbooks and risk tolerances directly into the reasoning flow.
- Capture the organisational learning loop by tying decisions to outcomes and producing auditable records for regulators and internal governance.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Harmonisation**: ELT pipelines feed a governed warehouse and feature store with mastered entities, policy rules, and reference data.
2. **Context Retrieval**: Semantic and rules-based retrieval assemble facts, comparable cases, and relevant regulations per decision context.
3. **Reasoning & Tooling**: An LLM agent orchestrates deterministic calculators, simulation engines, and optimisation solvers to generate scenarios and recommendations.
4. **Explanation Layer**: The system produces narratives with citations, highlights trade-offs, enumerates assumptions, and exposes model scores.
5. **Decision Capture**: Review UI records human overrides, notes, approvals, and downstream execution triggers while streaming telemetry for model monitoring.

## Discovery Questions
- What is the decision frequency, latency requirement, and acceptable residual risk for each decision class?
- Which simulation models, heuristics, or playbooks must be preserved and how often are they recalibrated?
- How should conflicting data sources be reconciled, and who is the source-of-truth owner?
- What retention, audit, and explainability obligations exist across jurisdictions or business units?

## Bill of Materials
- Data stack: Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery), feature store (Feast/Tecton), policy repository (OPA or Decision Model & Notation).
- Retrieval/search layer (pgvector, Elasticsearch) paired with agent runtime (LangChain, Semantic Kernel) and tool execution sandbox.
- Scenario modelling services (Python notebooks, Riskfuel APIs) with visual analytics (Streamlit, custom React console).
- Observability: lineage tracking, prompt log store, evaluation harness for decision accuracy, and RBAC integrated with IAM.

## Risks & Controls
- **Over-reliance on AI**: Force dual-control for high-risk calls, expose model limitations, and require human acknowledgement before execution.
- **Data Drift & Model Decay**: Implement population stability monitoring, champion/challenger strategies, and scheduled recalibration of tools.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Version policies, capture rationale with immutable storage, and map decisions to applicable regulations for auditors.
- **Security & Privacy**: Apply row-level access controls, redact sensitive fields in prompts, and encrypt decision logs at rest and in transit.
