# Pattern: Decision Support

## Business Value
- Deliver faster, higher-quality decisions with transparent evidence and what-if analysis.

## Technical Architecture
- Data pipelines -> feature store -> retrieval over facts and policies
- LLM reasoning augmented with tools for simulation and scenario analysis
- Explanation layer with citations, stated assumptions, and confidence scoring
- Feedback loop that captures outcomes to improve future recommendations

## Discovery Questions
- What decision cadence, owners, and tolerable risk levels are in play?
- Which policies, regulations, and source systems of record apply?
- What auditability, sign-off, and retention processes are required?

## Bill of Materials
- Data warehouse plus feature store, pgvector, OpenAI, tool runner for simulations, user interface, logging and tracing, approval workflow

## Risks & Controls
- Over-trust -> show citations and confidence; require human approval
- Data drift -> monitor inputs and accuracy; schedule recalibration
- Compliance -> retain decisions and rationale with strict access controls
