# Pattern: Decision Support

## Business Value
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Faster, higher‑quality decisions with transparent evidence and what‑if analysis.

## Technical Architecture
- Data pipelines → feature store → retrieval over facts/policies
- LLM reasoning with tools (simulation, scenario analysis)
- Explanation layer: citations, assumptions, confidence scoring
- Feedback loop: capture outcomes to improve future recommendations

## Discovery Questions
- Decision cadence, owners, and tolerable risk levels?
- Policies, regulations, and source systems of record?
- Required auditability and sign‑off processes?

## Bill of Materials
- Data warehouse + feature store; pgvector; OpenAI; tool runner (for sims); UI; logging/tracing; approval workflow

## Risks & Controls
- Over‑trust → show citations and confidence; require approval
- Data drift → monitor inputs and accuracy; scheduled recalibration
- Compliance → retain decisions and rationale with access controls
