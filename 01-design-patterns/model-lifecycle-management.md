# Pattern: Model Lifecycle Management (MLOps)

## Business Value
- Enable teams to deploy AI services rapidly and safely by providing consistent tooling for data prep, experimentation, deployment, and monitoring.
- Reduce outages and performance regressions through automated testing, observability, and rollback strategies anchored in measurable SLOs.
- Maintain regulatory and organisational trust by ensuring every model or prompt change is auditable, reproducible, and cost-aware.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data & Artefact Versioning**: Source-controlled datasets (DVC/LakeFS), feature stores, and prompt repositories capture provenance of training signals.
2. **Training & Evaluation Pipelines**: CI/CD orchestrates model training, fine-tuning, or prompt tuning with automated regression, bias, and robustness tests.
3. **Registry & Promotion**: Approved artefacts stored in MLflow/W&B with metadata (datasets, hyperparameters, eval scores) and staged promotion workflows.
4. **Deployment Engine**: Supports multiple targets (REST, streaming, batch, function-as-a-service) with canary/shadow rollouts and policy-aware routing.
5. **Monitoring & Feedback**: Unified observability pipeline tracks latency, cost, hallucination rates, and business KPIs; triggers retraining/reversion when thresholds breach.

## Discovery Questions
- What environments (dev/test/prod) exist and how are deployment approvals or rollback actions governed across them?
- Which compliance requirements mandate lineage tracking, data retention, or redaction for training and inference logs?
- How are latency, reliability, and cost budgets defined for each product tier, and who owns them?
- What is the current incident response process for model failures, and how will AI-specific runbooks integrate?

## Bill of Materials
- Source control & CI (GitHub/GitLab, Jenkins) with pipeline orchestration (Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions) and IaC (Terraform).
- Experimentation stack: MLflow/Weights & Biases, prompt management (PromptLayer, custom repos), evaluation suites (LangSmith, DeepEval).
- Deployment layer: Kubernetes/KServe, serverless endpoints (SageMaker, Vertex AI), API gateway, feature store (Feast) for online inference.
- Observability: Central logging (ELK), tracing (OpenTelemetry, Langfuse), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), and alerting (PagerDuty, Opsgenie).

## Risks & Controls
- **Uncontrolled Changes**: Enforce branch protections, approval workflows, and signed artefacts before promotion.
- **Quality Regressions**: Integrate automated eval gates, maintain golden datasets, and run post-deploy smoke tests.
- **Cost Overruns**: Monitor usage per model, implement autoscaling with budgets, cache frequent prompts/responses, and use lower-cost inference tiers when possible.
- **Compliance Gaps**: Store artefacts with retention policies, restrict access via RBAC, and provide audit-ready change logs linked to tickets.
