# Pattern: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Intelligence

## Business Value
- Provide planners and field operators with timely spatial insights that optimise asset placement, maintenance schedules, and emergency response routing.
- Fuse heterogeneous geospatial datasets to uncover growth opportunities, risk hotspots, and environmental impacts with defensible evidence.
- Reduce manual GIS workload by exposing natural-language interfaces that democratise access to complex spatial analytics.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion & Curation**: Stream satellite imagery, lidar, IoT sensors, cadastral records, and mobility data into a spatial data lake with licence metadata.
2. **Spatial Indexing**: Generate vector tiles, raster pyramids, and geohash indexes using PostGIS/BigQuery GIS to power fast proximity and overlay queries.
3. **Analytical Services**: Blend traditional spatial joins with ML models (segmentation, object detection) and route optimisation engines.
4. **Conversational Layer**: LLM interface grounded in metadata schemas translates natural-language questions into SQL/GeoSPARQL while enforcing permission checks.
5. **Visualisation & Actioning**: Interactive maps (Mapbox/Deck.gl) integrate with existing GIS platforms (Esri, QGIS) and trigger downstream workflows (work orders, alerts).

## Discovery Questions
- Which data providers and licences govern usage, and how frequently must layers be refreshed to stay decision-grade?
- What spatial resolution, coordinate systems, and accuracy tolerances are required for regulatory or engineering sign-off?
- How will outputs integrate with current GIS tooling, mobile field apps, or ERP systems powering operations?
- What access controls and anonymisation are needed to protect sensitive locations (critical infrastructure, personal address data)?

## Bill of Materials
- Spatial storage/compute: PostGIS, BigQuery GIS, or GeoMesa on a data lake; tile rendering (Mapbox GL Native, Tegola).
- ML pipeline: Raster analytics (Rasterio, GDAL), object detection models (YOLO, Mask R-CNN) tuned on domain imagery.
- Interaction layer: LLM middleware with schema-grounding, vector store for metadata (Weaviate/pgvector), and API gateway with rate limits.
- Observability & governance: Data lineage catalog (DataHub), licence compliance tracking, quality dashboards showing positional error and coverage.

## Risks & Controls
- **Data Licensing Violations**: Capture licence metadata at ingestion, automate usage checks, and restrict export of derived layers when prohibited.
- **Spatial Accuracy & Drift**: Run QA pipelines comparing against ground truth, surface error bounds, and alert when sensor calibration shifts.
- **Privacy Exposure**: Apply spatial aggregation, k-anonymity, or masking for personally identifiable locations and enforce geofenced access policies.
- **Operational Complexity**: Maintain IaC deployment blueprints and automated test suites for geospatial functions to avoid brittle configs.
