# Pattern: AI-Powered Vulnerability Management

## Business Value
- Reduce mean-time-to-detect and patch risk by prioritizing critical vulnerabilities.

## Technical Architecture
- Ingest CVEs, asset inventory, scanner outputs → risk scoring model
- LLM triage assistant with source links; ticketing integration
- Dashboards for coverage, SLA, and patch impact

## Discovery Questions
- Asset inventory completeness and exposure?
- Patch windows and change controls?
- Compliance frameworks (SOC2, ISO, NIST)?

## Bill of Materials
- Data store, scanners integrations, LLM, dashboards, ticketing

## Risks & Controls
- False prioritization → feedback loop; audit trail
- Sensitive data → access controls and redaction
