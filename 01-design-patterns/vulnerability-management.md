# Pattern: AI-Powered Vulnerability Management

## Business Value
- Shrink mean time to remediate critical vulnerabilities by continuously triaging findings against business impact, exploitability, and exposure.
- Provide security and engineering teams with contextual narratives, remediation guidance, and automated workflow routing to accelerate closure.
- Improve compliance posture by generating defensible evidence of coverage, prioritisation rationale, and SLA adherence.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Aggregation**: Normalise scanner outputs (Qualys, Tenable), asset inventory, CMDB, threat intel, and business metadata into a unified knowledge graph.
2. **Risk Scoring Engine**: Combine rule-based scoring (CVSS, EPSS) with ML models that account for asset criticality, compensating controls, and exploit chatter.
3. **AI Triage Assistant**: LLM-generated summaries highlight potential impact, recommended fixes, and link to patches or knowledge docs with citations.
4. **Workflow Integration**: Automated ticketing (Jira/ServiceNow), change window validation, and exception management with approval workflows.
5. **Monitoring & Reporting**: Dashboards track coverage, SLA compliance, trending vulnerabilities, and residual risk by business unit.

## Discovery Questions
- How accurate and complete is the asset inventory, and how are orphaned systems discovered or reconciled?
- What patching cadences and maintenance windows exist across infrastructure types (cloud, OT, endpoints)?
- Which regulatory or certification frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53) dictate reporting frequencies and evidence requirements?
- How are vulnerability exceptions approved, reviewed, and revisited over time?

## Bill of Materials
- Data platform: graph or document store (Neo4j, Elastic Common Schema) with streaming ingestion (Kafka) from scanners and CMDB.
- Threat intelligence enrichers (MISP, Recorded Future), ML pipeline for prioritisation, and LLM service (Azure OpenAI, Bedrock) for summarisation.
- Ticketing and change management connectors (ServiceNow, Jira, PagerDuty) with workflow engine for approvals.
- Analytics stack: BI dashboards (Power BI, Looker) and compliance reporting templates with automated evidence bundles.

## Risks & Controls
- **Misprioritised Findings**: Validate scoring against historical incidents, incorporate SME feedback loops, and allow manual overrides with rationale logging.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Mask environment details in AI prompts, enforce RBAC, and segregate data per sensitivity tier.
- **Alert Fatigue**: Tune deduplication, implement risk thresholds, and provide personalised queues for each engineering squad.
- **Change Management Conflicts**: Integrate with CAB processes, monitor for unapproved patches, and provide readiness checks before rollout.
