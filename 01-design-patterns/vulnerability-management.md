# Pattern: AI-Powered Vulnerability Management

**Mission:** Prioritise, remediate, and communicate security vulnerabilities using AI-driven triage, context, and automation.

## High-Value Use Cases
| Use Case | Impact | KPIs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk-based prioritisation | Focus on most critical issues first. | MTTR for critical vulns, risk reduction. |
| Automated ticket enrichment | Give engineers actionable context fast. | Ticket acceptance, time-to-fix. |
| Executive reporting | Summaries for leadership, compliance. | Report accuracy, delivery time. |
| Exception management | Track risk acceptance and revalidation. | Exception count, review compliance. |

## Experience Blueprint
| Stage | Human | AI/Agents | Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest & Normalise | SecOps imports scanner data, asset inventory. | Data agent deduplicates, enriches with business context, threat intel. | Vulnerability scanners, CMDB, threat feeds. |
| Prioritise | Security analysts review backlog, set strategy. | Scoring agent computes risk, exploit probability, business impact ranking. | Risk engine, ML models. |
| Assign & Remediate | Engineers receive tickets with guidance. | Triage agent generates remediation steps, links knowledge base. | Ticketing (Jira/ServiceNow), RPA. |
| Validate & Close | Security verifies fixes, runs scans. | QA agent validates, updates status, documents evidence. | Scanners, automation scripts. |
| Report & Improve | Leadership receives metrics, exceptions tracked. | Narrative agent summarises posture, compliance, trend insights. | Dashboards, Langfuse.

## Technical Architecture Stack
1. **Data Integration:** Ingest pipeline consolidating scanners (Qualys, Tenable), CMDB, business metadata, threat intel.  
2. **Risk Engine:** ML + rule-based scoring, asset criticality, exploit feeds.  
3. **Automation Layer:** Ticket enrichment, workflow automation, reminders, knowledge base integration.  
4. **Collaboration & Reporting:** Dashboards, exec brief generator, compliance exports.  
5. **Observability:** Activity logging, Langfuse traces, evaluation harness for accuracy.

## Data & Models
- Vulnerability data, asset inventory, business criticality, exploit databases (EPSS, CISA KEV), remediation knowledge.  
- Models: Risk scoring, classification, summarisation LLMs.  
- Tools: Prompt orchestrators, graph databases, analytics.

## Implementation Sprints
1. **Data Foundation** – Connect scanners, build unified schema, quality checks.  
2. **Risk Scoring** – Implement scoring models, calibrate thresholds.  
3. **Automation** – Enrich tickets, integrate workflows, notifications.  
4. **Reporting & Compliance** – Build dashboards, exec narratives, exception tracking.  
5. **Operations** – Incident response integration, SLA monitoring, retros.  
6. **Continuous Improvement** – Feedback loops, cost control, red-teaming.

## Agent Build Instructions
- Leverage CoE templates for BOM, architecture.  
- Scaffold project replicating `05-projects/eval-automation` to monitor summarisation accuracy.  
- Provide scripts: data ingestion, scoring, ticket generator, reporting.  
- Document process instructions for coding agents: add new data source, adjust scoring, create report.  
- Deliver final bundle: architecture doc, runbooks, evaluation results, governance mapping.

## Evaluation & Observability
- Accuracy of prioritisation (actual incidents vs score).  
- SLA metrics (MTTR, backlog burn).  
- Quality of summaries (Promptfoo, human review).  
- Langfuse metrics, cost, automation success.

## Governance & Controls
- Procurement for new tools/datasets.  
- Human oversight for severe risk acceptance decisions.  
- Incident response integration, postmortems.  
- Compliance reporting (SOC2, ISO).  
- Use governance library checklists.

## Deliverables & Templates
- Risk scoring model doc, architecture diagrams, BOM.  
- Runbook, incident plan, compliance binder.  
- Evaluation outputs, dashboards, storytelling deck.  
- Knowledge base articles for engineers.
