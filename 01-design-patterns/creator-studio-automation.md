# Pattern: Creator Studio Automation

**Mission:** Build an AI-assisted creator studio that transforms briefs into multi-channel content with brand-safe guardrails and analytics feedback loops.

## High-Value Use Cases
| Use Case | Impact | KPIs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campaign factory | Launch coordinated campaigns across channels in hours. | Time-to-publish <6h, engagement uplift 20%. |
| Persona-driven content | Tailor copy, visuals, CTAs for each segment. | CTR/conversion per persona. |
| Compliance & review | Keep tone, legal language, accessibility consistent. | Compliance violations, review SLA. |
| Analytics-to-prompt loop | Feed performance data into prompts weekly. | Improvement per iteration, content acceptance. |

## Experience Blueprint
| Stage | Human | AI/Agents | Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brief Intake | Marketing lead submits campaign brief, goals. | Brief agent normalises metadata, tags audiences. | Intake form (Notion/Asana), orchestrator. |
| Research & Inspiration | Creative strategist curates references. | Retrieval agent pulls brand assets, product facts, past wins. | Vector store, DAM. |
| Creation & Variants | Writers/designers guide iterations. | Generation agents draft scripts, copy, thumbnails, captions. | LLMs, diffusion models, prompt registry. |
| Review & Compliance | Brand/legal review, give feedback. | Guardrail agent runs policy checks, accessibility, style scoring, diff summary. | Policy engine, review console. |
| Publish & Amplify | Ops schedules posts/emails, monitors. | Distribution agent pushes to CMS, ESP, social; analytics agent logs metrics. | CMS, email, social schedulers, analytics warehouse. |
| Learn & Optimise | Team reviews performance, updates prompts. | Analytics agent surfaces insights, updates prompt packs, experimentation plan. | Data warehouse, dashboards, micro-modules.

## Technical Architecture Stack
1. **Workflow Engine:** Temporal/Camunda orchestrating tasks, approvals, SLA tracking.  
2. **Content Brain:** Knowledge base storing voice, offers, compliance rules, performance metrics.  
3. **Generation Layer:** LLM + image/voice models; prompt routing and versioning.  
4. **Guardrails:** Policy linting, compliance checklists, SEO/accessibility scoring, human review UI.  
5. **Distribution & Analytics:** Connectors to CMS, social, email; analytics ingestion, experimentation dashboards.  
6. **Observability:** Langfuse + Promptfoo, cost ledger, governance logging.

## Data & Models
- Brand voice matrices, product catalog, legal disclaimers, performance data, customer personas.  
- Models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, smaller instruct models, diffusion for imagery, speech synthesis (ElevenLabs).  
- Tools: Prompt orchestrators, evaluation harness, analytics connectors.

## Implementation Sprints
1. **Foundation** – Build orchestrator, knowledge base, guardrail config.  
2. **Generation Engine** – Set up prompt packs, retrieval, variant creation.  
3. **Review Console** – Implement compliance checks, diff viewer, review logs.  
4. **Distribution Automation** – Connect CMS/email/social; handle scheduling, metadata.  
5. **Analytics Loop** – Integrate performance data, update prompts, run experiments.  
6. **Governance & Scale** – Incident response, SLA dashboards, team training.

## Agent Build Instructions
- Reference CoE templates for creator studio architecture, BOM, user flows.  
- Clone `05-projects/creator-evals` and `eval-automation` for evaluation + analytics workflow.  
- Provide tasks for coding agents: create prompt pack, build guardrail tests, integrate analytics, produce dashboards, generate documentation.  
- Use `scripts/check_secrets.py`, `check_env.py` to verify keys.  
- Deliver final bundle: architecture doc, workflows, prompt library, evaluation outputs, analytics snapshot.

## Evaluation & Observability
- Promptfoo suite for tone, factuality, CTA strength.  
- Reviewer feedback metrics, compliance pass rate.  
- Engagement analytics, experiment results.  
- Langfuse telemetry for agent actions, cost.

## Governance & Controls
- Procurement/contract management for creative tools.  
- Human review SLA via `human-review-checklist`.  
- Incident response for content errors (public comms).  
- Policy mapping, audit evidence in governance library.

## Deliverables & Templates
- Campaign operating model deck, storyboard, style guide.  
- Prompt packs, guardrail config, review checklists.  
- Evaluation reports, analytics dashboards.  
- Storytelling assets (launch guide, retro).  
- Runbooks for incident handling, experimentation.
