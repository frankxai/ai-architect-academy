# Pattern: Genomic Sequence Processing & Public Health

## Business Value
- Compress turnaround from sample collection to actionable variant insights, enabling faster outbreak detection and clinical decision-making.
- Support cross-institutional collaboration with governed data sharing that balances research needs against patient privacy obligations.
- Provide epidemiologists and clinicians with contextualised summaries, lineage tracking, and therapeutic impact assessments.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Secure Data Intake**: Biospecimen metadata and raw sequencing files (FASTQ/BAM) land in encrypted, access-controlled storage with QC checks.
2. **Analysis Pipelines**: Workflow engines (Nextflow/Snakemake) orchestrate alignment, variant calling, annotation, and lineage assignment using validated reference genomes.
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Link variants to public databases (ClinVar, GISAID) and institutional knowledge graphs, capturing pathogenicity and therapeutic implications.
4. **Narrative & Reporting**: LLM assistant generates clinician-friendly briefs grounded in verified facts, highlighting confidence, quality metrics, and recommended follow-up.
5. **Governance Layer**: Audit trails, consent management, and data retention policies enforce compliance with HIPAA/GDPR and local bioethics reviews.

## Discovery Questions
- What sequencing platforms are in use, and what are the expected daily/weekly sample volumes and SLAs?
- Which regulatory regimes (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA) and data residency constraints dictate storage and processing choices?
- How will results be consumed (clinical dashboards, public health alerts, research portals), and what format is required?
- What collaboration agreements exist with external labs or agencies, and how are data access requests approved?

## Bill of Materials
- Workflow tooling (Nextflow, Cromwell) backed by HPC clusters or managed services (AWS Batch, Google Cloud Life Sciences).
- Domain toolchain: BWA/GATK for alignment and variant calling, Ensembl/VEP for annotation, lineage trackers (Pangolin) for pathogen surveillance.
- Security stack: encrypted storage (S3 with KMS), policy enforcement (OPA), consent ledger, and fine-grained IAM (Okta/Azure AD).
- Observability: pipeline telemetry (Prometheus), QC dashboards (Grafana), and reproducibility artefacts stored via DVC or Quilt.

## Risks & Controls
- **Privacy Breach**: Apply irreversible de-identification, segregate PHI, use differential privacy for aggregate reporting, and enforce least-privilege access.
- **Pipeline Reproducibility**: Version code, containers, and reference datasets; capture provenance metadata for every run.
- **Model Misinterpretation**: Ground LLM summaries in validated annotations, include confidence intervals, and require clinician acknowledgement.
- **Operational Bottlenecks**: Auto-scale compute resources, implement queue-based scheduling, and monitor pipeline KPIs for backlog prevention.
