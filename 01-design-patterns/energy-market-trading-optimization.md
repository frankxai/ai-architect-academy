# Pattern: Energy Market Trading & Optimization

## Business Value
- Increase gross margin by optimising bid strategies across day-ahead, intraday, and balancing markets while respecting regulatory constraints.
- Minimise imbalance penalties by pairing real-time telemetry with probabilistic forecasts of demand, supply, and renewable intermittency.
- Enable traders to scenario-plan around weather, fuel, and outage events using transparent narratives anchored in quantitative models.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Foundation**: Stream ingestion of SCADA metrics, weather feeds, fuel prices, and market data into a time-series lakehouse with quality SLAs.
2. **Forecasting Ensemble**: Combine statistical (ARIMA, Prophet) and ML (gradient boosting, deep temporal models) predictors with quantile outputs for uncertainty.
3. **Optimisation Engine**: Solver (Gurobi/CPLEX/OR-Tools) enforces physical constraints, ramp rates, and risk limits to generate bid curves and dispatch schedules.
4. **Agentic Advisory Layer**: LLM orchestrator translates optimisation outputs into trader-friendly narratives, highlights sensitivities, and surfaces compliance checks.
5. **Monitoring & Feedback**: Backtesting harness compares realised vs. forecasted outcomes, recalibrates models, and logs rationale for audit trails.

## Discovery Questions
- Which market products (energy, capacity, ancillary services) and geographies are in scope, and what are their clearing deadlines?
- What telemetry exists for asset availability, and how is maintenance or forced outage data captured today?
- How are risk tolerances defined (VaR, CVaR, position limits), and who approves overrides?
- What regulatory reporting obligations apply (REMIT, FERC), and how must recommendations be recorded?

## Bill of Materials
- Time-series storage (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) feeding a lakehouse (Delta/Snowflake) with data quality monitors.
- Forecasting stack (tsfresh, GluonTS, Prophet) orchestrated via MLFlow plus optimisation solver (Gurobi, OR-Tools) exposed through microservices.
- Messaging infrastructure (Kafka/Redpanda) for streaming updates, trader workstation UI (React, Plotly), and observability (Prometheus, Grafana).
- Governance artefacts: model registry, scenario library, compliance log store with immutable retention (e.g., Azure WORM storage).

## Risks & Controls
- **Forecast Error & Model Drift**: Implement champion/challenger evaluation, rolling window retraining, and manual fallback strategies during anomalies.
- **Market Compliance Breaches**: Encode bidding rules and reporting thresholds as machine-readable policies; enforce maker-checker approval for manual edits.
- **Operational Latency**: Stress-test end-to-end pipelines against clearing deadlines, and maintain hot-standby infrastructure for failover.
- **Cybersecurity**: Segment OT/IT networks, enforce MFA for trader tools, and monitor for adversarial data poisoning on external feeds.
