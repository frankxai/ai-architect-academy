# Pattern: Energy Market Trading & Optimisation

**Mission:** Optimise bidding, dispatch, and risk management across energy markets with transparent analytics and resilient operations.

## High-Value Use Cases
| Use Case | Impact | KPIs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day-ahead bidding optimisation | Maximise margins while respecting constraints. | Gross margin uplift, constraint violations = 0. |
| Intraday balancing & risk hedging | Reduce imbalance charges, manage intermittency. | Imbalance cost %, reserve utilisation. |
| Asset health & outage response | Quickly re-optimise when units fail. | Response time <15 min, availability. |
| Market intelligence & reporting | Produce trader briefings, regulatory submissions. | Report turnaround, compliance breaches avoided. |

## Experience Blueprint
| Stage | Human | AI/Agents | Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data & Forecast Prep | Ops ingests telemetry, traders review anomalies. | Data agent validates streams, backfills gaps, triggers alerts. | SCADA feeds, weather APIs, market data lake. |
| Forecast Generation | Quants tune models, set scenario assumptions. | Forecast agent runs ensemble (statistical + ML), quantile outputs, confidence bands. | Forecast service (Prophet, XGBoost, deep models). |
| Optimisation & Simulation | Traders configure constraints, risk appetite. | Optimisation agent runs solvers (Gurobi, OR-Tools), scenario agent performs Monte Carlo stress. | Solver cluster, risk engine. |
| Recommendation & Execution | Trader reviews recommended bids/dispatch. | LLM assistant summarises strategy, provides citations, push to market API. | Bid submission service, Langfuse trace. |
| Monitoring & Feedback | Control room monitors results, logs overrides. | Feedback agent tracks actual vs planned, triggers retraining/backtesting tasks. | Observability stack, evaluation pipeline. |

## Technical Architecture Stack
1. **Data Platform:** Time-series lakehouse (Delta/TimescaleDB), weather + commodity ingestion pipelines, quality monitors.  
2. **Forecasting Service:** Microservice exposing model ensembles, feature store, retraining scheduler.  
3. **Optimisation Core:** Solver infrastructure with constraint library (ramp rates, maintenance, regulatory caps).  
4. **Decision Support Layer:** Agent orchestrator generating narratives, dashboards, compliance reports.  
5. **Execution & Risk:** Integration with market APIs, PPA hedging tools, risk analytics.  
6. **Observability:** Langfuse for agent trace, Prometheus/Grafana, Promptfoo for explanation accuracy.

## Data & Models
- Telemetry (MW output, temperatures), market price curves, maintenance schedules, regulatory data.  
- Models: ARIMA, Prophet, gradient boosting, deep temporal (Temporal Fusion Transformer), reinforcement learning for continuous optimisation (optional).  
- Tools: Scenario simulators, risk calculators (VaR/CVaR), LLMs for summarisation.

## Implementation Sprints
1. **Data Foundation** – Stabilise ingestion, create unified dataset, set data contracts.  
2. **Forecasting Ensemble** – Build baseline models, evaluate accuracy vs benchmarks.  
3. **Optimisation Engine** – Codify constraints, integrate solver, run backtests.  
4. **Trader Workbench** – UI/agent outputs with scenario comparisons, compliance stamps.  
5. **Automation & Ops** – Hook into market APIs, set guardrails, run incident drills.  
6. **Continuous Improvement** – Cost dashboards, evaluation harness, periodic recalibration.

## Agent Build Instructions
- Reference `AI CoE Templates/.../energy-market` technical architecture docs.  
- Use `05-projects` for ingestion/eval scaffolds (clone `domain-rag` for retrieval, adapt to time-series).  
- Implement solver microservice in repo (K8s job or serverless).  
- Generate documentation bundle: architecture, runbook, evaluation metrics, regulatory checklist.  
- Provide mock UI storyboard using CoE template; capture screens.  
- Deliver scenario library enabling coding agents to test extremes.

## Evaluation & Observability
- Forecast accuracy: MAE/MAPE per horizon, bias detection.  
- Optimisation outcomes: revenue vs baseline, constraint breaches, sensitivity metrics.  
- Guardrails: compliance with bidding rules, override logs.  
- Telemetry: Langfuse traces, solver runtime, cost.

## Governance & Controls
- Procurement & vendor risk (external data providers) via `AI-procurement-checklist`.  
- Incident response for market failures via `incident-response-checklist`.  
- Human oversight for critical decisions (trader approvals) via `human-review-checklist`.  
- Audit requirements (reporting to regulators) tracked in governance library.

## Deliverables & Templates
- Strategy memo, architecture diagrams, BOM adapted from CoE templates.  
- Evaluation report (forecasts, optimisation results).  
- Control room playbook, escalation tree, compliance binder.  
- Weekly narrative summarising performance to leadership.
