# Pattern: Intelligent Orchestration Workflow

## Business Value
- Break complex, multi-step AI tasks into reliable, reusable workflows that coordinate humans, classical services, and AI agents.
- Increase throughput and consistency of operations (claims handling, onboarding, content approvals) without losing governance checkpoints.
- Provide visibility into end-to-end process health, service levels, and bottlenecks for continuous improvement.

## Technical Architecture
1. **Process Modelling**: Declarative workflow definitions (BPMN, state machines) capture tasks, branching logic, SLAs, and escalation paths.
2. **Task Execution Layer**: Mix of deterministic microservices, human tasks, and AI agents executed via orchestration runtime (Temporal, Camunda, Airflow).
3. **Context Management**: Shared data layer maintains case files, documents, and embeddings accessible to each step with strict access policies.
4. **Monitoring & SLAs**: Real-time metrics on task durations, queue lengths, and outcomes feed dashboards and automated escalation policies.
5. **Change & Experimentation**: Feature flags and A/B testing frameworks allow incremental rollout of new agents or task strategies.

## Discovery Questions
- Which business processes are in scope, and what are the critical SLAs or compliance checkpoints within them?
- How will human workers interact with the workflow (inbox, email, custom UI), and what training or change management is required?
- What systems of record must be integrated, and how are credentials or API access managed?
- What auditability is expected (event logs, approvals, artefact retention), and who consumes the reports?

## Bill of Materials
- Orchestration engine (Temporal, Camunda, Airflow) with scalable task queue and retry semantics.
- Integration services: API gateway, connector library, RPA bots if legacy screen automation is required.
- AI components: LLM agent framework (LangChain, Semantic Kernel), RAG knowledge base, evaluation harness for agent performance.
- Monitoring stack: event log warehouse, observability tools (Grafana, Kibana), and business dashboards (Looker, Power BI).

## Risks & Controls
- **Process Drift**: Version workflows, require change control, and simulate impact before deployment.
- **Brittle Integrations**: Implement contract testing and circuit breakers for external APIs; maintain fallback human tasks.
- **Compliance Failures**: Enforce segregation-of-duties, capture approval evidence, and maintain immutable event logs.
- **User Adoption**: Provide transparency into agent decisions, enable easy overrides, and collect feedback loops for continuous tuning.
