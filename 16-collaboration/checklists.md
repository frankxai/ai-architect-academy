# Checklists (Before/After)

Before Asking
- [ ] Define success in 1–2 sentences
- [ ] Gather context (files, logs, env)
- [ ] Decide output format (diff, plan, code, table)
- [ ] Note constraints (performance, security, style)

After Receiving
- [ ] Sanity check: does it meet acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Apply minimal diff; run tests; lint
- [ ] Add/adjust docs; create PR with summary
- [ ] Capture follow‑ups as issues
