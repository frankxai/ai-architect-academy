# AI Architect Academy - Business Model Knowledge Base
*Decision Framework for Smooth, Smart, Passive Revenue*

> **Purpose:** This document outlines user personas, revenue models, community platforms, and execution strategies for AI Architect Academy. Use this as input for strategic discussions and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Core Constraints & Considerations

### **Frank's Situation**
- ✅ Oracle AI Architect (day job, 40 hours/week)
- ✅ Multiple projects (AI Music Academy, Arcanea, AI Architect Academy)
- ✅ AI Architect Academy is NOT main passion (but has value)
- ✅ Want maximum automation and passive income
- ✅ Available time: 5-15 hours/week for this project
- ✅ Domain owned: aiarchitectacademy.com

### **Critical Legal Consideration: Oracle Employment**

**MUST RESOLVE BEFORE MONETIZING:**

**Typical Tech Employment Agreements Include:**
1. **IP Assignment Clause**: Anything you create may belong to Oracle
2. **Conflict of Interest**: Can't compete with employer's business
3. **Moonlighting Policy**: May require disclosure/approval for side income
4. **Non-Compete**: May restrict certain business activities

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review Oracle employment contract (especially IP/invention assignment)
- [ ] Check Oracle's side project policy handbook
- [ ] Determine if AI training/education competes with Oracle University
- [ ] Consider formal disclosure to manager/legal department
- [ ] Get written approval if required

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Low Risk**: Pure open source with no monetization
- **Medium Risk**: Sponsorships/donations (GitHub Sponsors, Patreon)
- **High Risk**: Competing SaaS product without disclosure
- **Highest Risk**: Hiding profitable side business from employer

**Recommendation:** Be transparent. Present as "open source education project with community support" rather than "competing training business."
