# 100‑Hour AI Architect Plan

Format: 4 weeks × ~25 hours/week. Focus on shipping real artifacts weekly.

Week 1 — Foundations (25h)
- LLM basics (6h): tokenization, attention, prompting

- Hands‑on (10h): RAG with citations and eval harness
- Assessment (3h): demo + reflection

Week 3 — Governance & Performance (25h)
- Privacy/GDPR (4h), model risk (4h)
- Performance & cost (6h): caching, batch, smaller models
- Hands‑on (8h): optimize RAG; add guardrails
- Assessment (3h): doc architecture & SLOs

Week 4 — Specialization & Portfolio (25h)
- Industry pattern (6h): choose domain
- Project (15h): complete end‑to‑end PoC
