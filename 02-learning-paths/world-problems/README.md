# World Problems AI Learning Paths

Apply enterprise AI architecture skills to address humanity's most pressing challenges. These learning paths connect technical expertise with real-world impact.

## Available Tracks

| Track | Focus Areas | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [Climate AI](climate-ai.md) | Carbon modeling, emissions optimization, climate prediction, renewable energy | 8-10 weeks |
| [Health AI](health-ai.md) | Drug discovery, medical imaging, clinical NLP, personalized medicine | 10-12 weeks |
| [Education AI](education-ai.md) | Adaptive learning, accessibility, assessment, AI literacy | 8-10 weeks |
| [Economic AI](economic-ai.md) | Financial inclusion, resource allocation, poverty reduction, labor markets | 8-10 weeks |

## Path Structure

Each learning path follows a consistent structure:

1. **Foundations Module** - Domain data, standards, and regulatory requirements
2. **Core Technical Modules** - 4-5 modules covering key AI applications
3. **Responsible AI Module** - Ethics, governance, and accountability
4. **Capstone Projects** - 3 options for portfolio-ready deliverables

## Prerequisites

All paths assume completion of:
- `02-learning-paths/beginner.md` or equivalent experience
- Foundational ML/AI concepts
- Python and cloud infrastructure familiarity

## Skill Connections

These paths leverage and extend the AI Architect Academy skills:

| Academy Skill | World Problems Application |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| `oracle-adk` | Agent-based monitoring and optimization |
| `mcp-architecture` | Domain-specific data connectors |
| `langgraph-patterns` | Multi-step reasoning workflows |
| `oci-services-expert` | Scalable deployment infrastructure |

## Cross-Path Synergies

Many world problems intersect:

- **Climate + Economic**: Carbon markets, green finance, just transition
- **Health + Economic**: Healthcare access, cost optimization
- **Education + Economic**: Workforce development, skills gaps
- **Climate + Health**: Environmental health, disease prediction
- **Education + Health**: Medical training, patient education

## Getting Started

1. Take the self-assessment in `02-learning-paths/self-assessment.md`
2. Choose a track based on your domain interest
3. Complete Module 1 (Foundations) of your chosen track
4. Join the community channel for your track
5. Connect with domain mentors

## Enterprise Integration

These paths prepare you to:

- Build production-grade AI systems in regulated domains
- Navigate compliance requirements (HIPAA, FERPA, financial regulations)
- Design governance frameworks for high-stakes AI applications
- Create business cases for AI investments with social impact
- Lead cross-functional teams combining AI and domain expertise

## Contributing

Help expand these learning paths:
