# Creator Content Orchestration Sprint

**Category:** Creator Systems  
**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Outcome:** Stand up an AI-assisted production board that takes briefs to multi-channel assets with brand-safe guardrails.

## Why it matters
- Creator teams juggle ideation, scripting, editing, and publishing across multiple channels; automation keeps the cadence sustainable.
- Structured hand-offs between humans and AI reduce brand risk while allowing experimentation with new formats.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a campaign brief or editorial calendar (Notion/Asana export works).
- Local copy of [`01-design-patterns/creator-studio-automation.md`](../../01-design-patterns/creator-studio-automation.md).
- Prompt tooling (Promptfoo or LangChain notebooks) to test candidate prompts.

## Step-by-step
1. **Map the pipeline:** Sketch the stages (brief ? outline ? script ? edit ? publish) and assign human/AI responsibilities.
2. **Create prompt packs:** Draft structured prompts for outline, hook, CTA, and SEO blurb generation. Store in a `prompts/creator/` folder.
3. **Wire data sources:** Connect brand voice snippets, product FAQs, and performance metrics into a lightweight retrieval layer (e.g., `docs/data/creator-voice.json`).
4. **Set review gates:** Define human approval points and add checklist items (style, compliance, accessibility). Capture them in the orchestrator or a Kanban template.
5. **Automate publishing prep:** Generate distribution copy (YouTube description, LinkedIn post, newsletter teaser) reusing the same source snippets.
6. **Log metrics:** Decide which KPIs feed back (CTR, watch time, saves). Add placeholders for analytics ingestion in `reports/creator/`.

## Deliverables
- Pipeline diagram or state machine exported to `assets/creator-pipeline.png`.
- Prompt pack (`prompts/creator/*.md`) with rationale and guardrails.
- Review checklist embedded in your project management tool or saved as `04-templates/creator-review-checklist.md`.
