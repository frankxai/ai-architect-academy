# Micro-Learning Atlas

Rapid-fire modules designed for 45-minute deep dives. Each micro-lesson pairs a single outcome with hands-on artefacts, updated for the September 2025 AI architecture landscape. Use this index to stitch custom learning journeys or supplement the 100-Hour Plan.

**How to use it**
- Pair each module with the [Learning Logbook](../logbook.md) to capture progress.
- After each sprint, run the [Retrospective with AI workflow](../../15-workflows/retrospective-with-ai.md).
- Drop artefacts (dashboards, notebooks, briefs) into the matching project folder under `05-projects/` or `09-articles/`.
