# Professional Path — Architecting End-to-End AI Platforms (6 Weeks)

For senior builders, consultants, and product leaders ready to operate as cross-functional AI architects. This curriculum pairs deep technical builds with executive-ready storytelling and operational rigor. Treat it as a live residency: each week you will ship artifacts, run stakeholder reviews, and leave breadcrumbs for your Codex-style agents to accelerate the next sprint.

## Strategic Goals
- Stand up a modular AI platform spanning ingestion, orchestration, evaluation, and governance.
- Develop a reusable playbook for launching, scaling, and monitoring AI-powered products.
- Produce executive narratives, pricing models, and enablement content that drive adoption.
- Cultivate an agent workforce capable of handling research, documentation, and automation tasks alongside you.

## Structure & Commitments
- **Duration:** 6 weeks, ~20 hours per week.
- **Operating Rhythm:** Monday strategy review, Tuesday–Thursday build blocks, Friday validation + publishing. Maintain a living roadmap referencing [00-roadmap/ROADMAP.md](../00-roadmap/ROADMAP.md).
- **Source of Truth:** `professional-portfolio/` folder in your repo clone containing architecture, prompts, evaluations, and comms.

## Week 1 — Enterprise Discovery & Portfolio Setup

- **Human Focus:** Conduct discovery interviews using [04-templates/discovery-questions.md](../04-templates/discovery-questions.md); map stakeholders with [experience-map.svg](../assets/experience-map.svg); inventory current systems.
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Summarize transcripts, highlight blockers, and propose opportunity statements referencing [03-awesome/awesome-aggregators.md](../03-awesome/awesome-aggregators.md).
- **Deliverables:** Discovery report, stakeholder map, prioritized use case backlog, and communication plan rooted in [BRAND-VOICE.md](../BRAND-VOICE.md).

## Week 2 — Data, Retrieval, and Knowledge Fabric

- **Human Focus:** Design ingestion pipelines, taxonomies, and metadata strategies. Prototype hybrid search referencing [docs/topics/hybrid-search.html](../docs/topics/hybrid-search.html) and [vector-search-pgvector.md](../05-projects/vector-search-pgvector.md).
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Generate schema proposals, data quality scorecards, and migration checklists. Draft ingestion scripts and documentation.
- **Deliverables:** Data architecture deck, PGVector proof with benchmark results, ingestion SOPs, and risk assessment covering privacy + retention (align with [privacy-gdpr.md](../08-governance/privacy-gdpr.md)).

---

## Week 3 — Application Platform & Agentic Workflows

- **Human Focus:** Implement modular service architecture using [RAG on Supabase](../05-projects/rag-on-supabase.md) plus an agent orchestrator inspired by [agentic-swarms](../agentic-swarms/README.md). Layer in tool access, routing, and escalation paths.
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Author prompt libraries, generate API reference docs, and propose automated tests. Evaluate conversation logs for failure patterns.
- **Deliverables:** Deployed service (staging), prompt pack repository, test coverage report, and decision log for tool selection.

---

## Week 4 — Observability, Evaluation, and Reliability Engineering

- **Human Focus:** Instrument tracing, metrics, and alerts using [metrics.md](../07-evaluation/metrics.md) and [docs/topics/observability.html](../docs/topics/observability.html). Build evaluation harness based on [eval-harness.md](../07-evaluation/eval-harness.md) and integrate into CI.
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Generate dashboards (JSON/YAML definitions), evaluation datasets, and nightly regression prompts. Synthesize incident simulations and runbooks.
- **Deliverables:** Monitoring plan, evaluation dashboards, automated regression job, and incident response playbook.

---

## Week 5 — Governance, Compliance, and Product Operations

- **Human Focus:** Establish governance board, risk controls, and product lifecycle rituals referencing [model-risk.md](../08-governance/model-risk.md) and [16-collaboration](../16-collaboration/). Align legal, security, and product stakeholders.
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Draft policy documents, intake forms, change management comms, and audit trails. Suggest automation for approvals and compliance evidence gathering.
- **Deliverables:** Governance operating model, policy library, risk register, and change management calendar. Publish an internal FAQ anchored in [docs/topics/guardrails.html](../docs/topics/guardrails.html).

---

## Week 6 — Commercialization, Enablement, and Launch Narrative

- **Human Focus:** Develop pricing/ROI models, marketing copy, and enablement experiences. Package learnings into workshops using [workshop-agenda.md](../04-templates/workshop-agenda.md) and solution collateral with [solution-doc.md](../04-templates/solution-doc.md).
- **AI Agent Tasks:** Draft website sections, SEO-optimized blog posts, and pitch emails referencing [docs/search.html](../docs/search.html) and [10-resources/videos.md](../10-resources/videos.md) for inspiration. Create success stories and testimonials from logs.
- **Deliverables:** Go-to-market kit (deck, one-pager, pricing sheet), enablement curriculum, public launch post, and recorded demo. Finalize `professional-portfolio/README.md` summarizing assets.

## Performance Metrics & Evidence
- Weekly OKRs tracked in your journal with measurable KPIs (latency, accuracy, adoption, satisfaction).
- Evaluation trendlines maintained in Langfuse or chosen platform with thresholds documented.
- Stakeholder satisfaction pulse (survey or interviews) aggregated at Week 3 and Week 6 checkpoints.
- PR-ready story capturing the transformation from discovery to launch.

## Transition Plan
- Hand off operations to product squads with runbooks and escalation matrix.
- Set quarterly architecture reviews and monthly governance forums.
- Continue with the [Bootcamp Path](bootcamp.md) for new regions/business units or dive into the [Agentic Code Swarms](agentic-code-swarms.md) specialization to scale automation.

Your north star: operate as the architect who can speak business, design resilient systems, and orchestrate human + AI collaborators with confidence.
