# Professional Path (6 Weeks)

Ideal for architects balancing delivery and leadership responsibilities (~12-15 hours/week).

## Structure Overview
- **Weeks 1-2:** Solidify retrieval + agent systems while setting baselines for evals.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Embed governance, risk, and cost practices into day-to-day operations.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Specialise by domain and create teaching material for your org.

## Detailed Plan
| Week | Theme | Focus Areas | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Retrieval Excellence | Hybrid search, chunking, multi-tenant design | Search service blueprint + benchmark report |
| 2 | Agents & Automation | Tool choreography, LangGraph patterns, failure recovery | Agent flow deck + incident playbook |
| 3 | Observability & Evals | Langfuse dashboards, promptfoo CI, data drift alerts | Eval summary + trace library |
| 4 | Governance in Practice | DPIA updates, policy mapping, access reviews | Governance cockpit doc + risk board |
| 5 | Industry Playbooks | Tailor patterns for a chosen vertical, map integrations | Domain playbook + partner alignment memo |
| 6 | Teach & Scale | Build enablement assets, mentor peers, host workshop | Workshop agenda, recording, updated poster |

## Mentorship Moments
- Pair each week with a 30-minute mentor sync using the questions in `16-collaboration/working-with-ai.md`.
- Swap eval results and guardrail ideas with peers via `15-workflows/peer-review.md`.

## Portfolio & Promotion
- Capture new visuals (screenshots, hero art) and append to `assets/` + `docs/assets/` as you progress.
- Maintain a change log in `02-learning-paths/logbook.md` (create if needed) highlighting wins, metrics, and stories.
- When ready, submit a PR to share your vertical playbook or workflow so others can build on it.
