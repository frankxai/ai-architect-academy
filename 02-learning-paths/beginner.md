# Beginner Path — Creator Launch Sequence (4 Weeks)

Designed for creators, educators, and advocates who want to teach AI architecture responsibly. Expect ~8–10 hours per week across async study, micro-builds, and storytelling.

## Outcomes
- Explain core AI architecture concepts with clarity (retrieval, agents, evaluation, governance).
- Facilitate workshops or community sessions that demonstrate safe prompting and responsible usage.
- Publish at least three artifacts (newsletter, tutorial, talk track) aligned with the Brand Voice playbook.

## Weekly Flow
| Week | Focus | Key Activities | Teaching Assets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Week 1 — Narrative Foundations** | Positioning, personas, value loops | Study [START-HERE](../START-HERE.md), craft audience personas, map value loop storyboard, draft welcome newsletter | [Brand Voice](../BRAND-VOICE.md), [Experience guide](../docs/experience.html) |
| **Week 2 — Retrieval & Prompt Craft** | Prompt design, retrieval mental models, safe defaults | Run mini RAG lab using [vector search](../05-projects/vector-search-pgvector.md), capture screenshots, create cheat sheet | [Design Patterns](../01-design-patterns/), [Resources hub](../10-resources/) |
| **Week 3 — Governance & Trust Signals** | Privacy, risk, evaluation narratives | Summarise [privacy](../08-governance/privacy-gdpr.md) & [model risk](../08-governance/model-risk.md) into workshop slides, design "trust checklist" handout | [Governance checklists](../08-governance/checklists.md), [Metrics](../07-evaluation/metrics.md) |
| **Week 4 — Launch & Amplify** | Community delivery, storytelling, feedback loops | Host a live session or recorded tutorial, publish recap article, solicit feedback for iteration | [Article outlines](../09-articles/), [Collaboration playbook](../16-collaboration/working-with-ai.md) |

## Teaching Model
- **Micro-drops.** 20-minute videos or async primers paired with practice prompts so learners can teach the content immediately.
- **Office hours.** Weekly 45-minute clinics to critique decks, review tutorials, and adjust messaging.
- **Peer review.** Participants swap scripts, slides, and demos for critique using `16-collaboration/peer-review.md`.

## Portfolio Checklist
- Welcome or announcement email/newsletter.
- 30–45 minute workshop outline including demos, risks, and Q&A prompts.
- Visual explainer (slide, infographic, or short-form video) linking to the repo and encouraging cloning.

## Next Moves
- Transition into the [Professional Architect Studio](professional.md) once you’re ready to ship complex systems.
- Partner with executives by attending the [AI CoE Bootcamp](bootcamp.md).
- Contribute back: submit your workshop templates to `04-templates/` and record learnings in `example-sessions/`.
