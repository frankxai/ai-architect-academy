# Beginner Path (4 Weeks)

A ramp for builders spending ~6 hours/week. Pair it with the self-assessment to track progress.

## Weekly Flow
| Week | Focus | Outcomes | Guided Assets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LLM fundamentals + safe prompting | Cheatsheet covering tokens, sampling, prompt patterns, safety guardrails | `START-HERE.md`,  `16-collaboration/prompting-guide.md` |
| 2 | Retrieval + embeddings + pgvector basics | Hands-on notebook building hybrid retrieval over your own notes | `05-projects/vector-search-pgvector.md`, `01-design-patterns/rag-pattern.md` |
| 3 | Intro agents + tool orchestration | Simple agent that calls two tools (search + summarise) with evaluation checklist | `agentic-swarms/README.md`, `06-toolchains/stack-reference.md` |
| 4 | Evaluations + observability | Promptfoo suite with faithfulness + toxicity checks, retro using `15-workflows/retrospective-with-ai.md` | `07-evaluation/eval-harness.md`, `05-projects/evals-langfuse.md` |

## Practice Rituals
- Assign one module per week from the [Micro-Learning Atlas](micro-learning.md) to reinforce hands-on practice. Log artefacts in `05-projects/sandboxes/`.
- Ship a tiny artifact each week (notebook, README, Loom) and store it in `05-projects/sandboxes/`.
- Use the `assets/ai-architect-education-poster.png` as a visual anchor for study groups.
- Run a 30-minute wrap-up retro every Friday using the prompts in `15-workflows/postmortem.md`.

## Graduation Checklist
- You can explain how embeddings, prompts, and guardrails work together.
- You have a working retrieval notebook and a basic agent script with evals.
- You can run Langfuse locally and interpret trace metrics.
