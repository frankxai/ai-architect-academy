# Bootcamp Path — AI Center of Excellence Alignment

Three intensive weeks for heads of AI, platform leaders, and cross-functional squads. Designed to align roadmap, governance, budget, and talent around measurable outcomes. Plan for 12–14 hours per week plus two executive councils.

## Bootcamp Outcomes
- Shared AI operating model (vision, value loops, operating cadence) grounded in current capabilities and risk appetite.
- Platform architecture decision with vendor comparison, cost/latency forecasts, and integration backlog.
- Governance baseline covering privacy, security, compliance, incident response, and responsible AI commitments.

## Weekly Agenda
| Week | Council & Focus | Key Sessions | Artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Week 1 — Diagnose & Frame** | Council: product + exec sponsors | Experience walkthrough, stakeholder interviews, capability mapping, risk heatmap | Vision brief, capability matrix, stakeholder map |
| **Week 2 — Architect & Decide** | Council: platform + engineering leads | Platform matrix review, retrieval & agent demos, cost modelling, integration sequencing | Platform scorecard, integration backlog, budget plan |
| **Week 3 — Govern & Launch** | Council: legal, compliance, data, security | Policy workshops, incident tabletop, measurement framework, communications plan | Governance playbook, KPI dashboard draft, rollout narrative |

## Daily Rhythm (per week)
- **Day 1:** 90-minute briefing (experience map, roadmap, best-in-class benchmarks) followed by executive working session.
- **Day 2:** Technical deep dive — review architecture options, integration requirements, security posture.
- **Day 3:** Governance workshop using `08-governance/` templates plus risk scenario drills.
- **Day 4:** Metrics & evaluation clinic leveraging [metrics](../07-evaluation/metrics.md), `promptfoo` harnesses, and Langfuse dashboards.
- **Day 5:** Story & alignment — craft executive update, Q&A rehearsal, and action plan.

## Assessment & Success Signals
- **Alignment (30%)** — Clarity of shared vision, prioritised capability map, stakeholder sign-off.
- **Architecture (30%)** — Quality of platform decision, integration plan, budget and SLO targets.
- **Governance (25%)** — Coverage of policies, risk mitigation plan, incident response readiness.
- **Storytelling (15%)** — Executive-ready narrative, communications plan, and feedback loop.

## Post-Bootcamp Actions
- Assign owners for roadmap initiatives and governance rituals (`16-collaboration/weekly-sync.md`).
- Launch a cross-functional observability rollout with the [Professional Studio](professional.md) team.
- Track progress with quarterly reviews mapped to the [Curriculum Architecture](curriculum-architecture.md) to keep cohorts aligned.
