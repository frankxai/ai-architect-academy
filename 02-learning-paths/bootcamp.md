# Bootcamp Path (AI CoE Inspired)

Three intense weeks (~35 hours/week) designed for leaders building or scaling internal AI programs.

## Week 1 — Vision, Patterns, Customer Journeys
- Kick off with the [Micro-Learning Atlas](micro-learning.md) modules for Context Engineering and Executive Narrative to prime stakeholders.
- **Discovery workshops:** Facilitate the questions in `01-design-patterns/value-pattern.md` with stakeholders.
- **Experience blueprint:** Pair `docs/experience.html` with the hero image `assets/ai-architect-campus.png` to outline end-to-end journeys.
- **Outcome:** A signed-off narrative including personas, success metrics, and high-level roadmap stored in `00-roadmap/ROADMAP.md`.

## Week 2 — Architecture, Integration, Operations
- **Deep dives:** Map reference architectures using `12-concepts/rag-architecture.md` + `06-toolchains/stack-reference.md`.
- **Implementation lab:** Stand up a production-ready retrieval service and an agent workflow with observability.
- **Governance cockpit:** Complete DPIA, risk matrix, and policy guardrails; review with security using `08-governance/` templates.
- **Outcome:** Architecture dossier + cost model + operational checklists.

## Week 3 — Industry Focus, Launch, Storytelling
- **Choose vertical:** Use `01-design-patterns/industry/` and `11-hyperscalers/` to pin down compliance + integration needs.
- **Launch playbook:** Produce GTM briefs, enablement docs, and a walkthrough video starring the `assets/ai-architect-professor.png` mentor persona.
- **Community loop:** Publish a thought-leadership article in `09-articles/` and schedule a governance retro.
- **Outcome:** Executive-ready program brief, demo assets, and a 90-day execution plan.

## Final Gate Review
Use the `15-workflows/ai-briefing.md` template. You are ready to scale if:
1. Strategy, architecture, and governance docs are linked from a single source of truth.
2. A working prototype demonstrates value + guardrails, with eval data attached.
3. Comms plan (slides, poster, article) is share-ready for leadership and customers.
